{"context": " ok ,  i'm going to begin this lecture by giving you your next assignment .\n remember i said that at some point during this semester i wanted you to attend an exhibit at the fairy street gallery and then write about it ?\n well ,  the exhibit that i want you to attend is coming up .\n it's already started in fact ,  but it'll be at the gallery for the next month ,  which should give you plenty of time to complete this assignment .\n the name of the artist exhibiting there is rose frantzen .\n frantzen's work may be unfamiliar to you since she's a relatively young artist .\n but she's got a very unusual style ,  compared to some of the artists we've looked at this term .\n but anyway ,  frantzen's style is what she herself calls realistic impressionism .\n so you've probably studied both of these movements separately ,  separate movements ,  realism and impressionism ,  in some of your art history courses .\n so who can just sum these up ?\n well ,  impressionism started in the late 19th century .\n um the basic impressionist style was very different from earlier styles .\n it didn't depict scenes or models exactly as they looked .\n um  impressionist painters tended to apply paint really thickly ,  and in big brushstrokes ,  so the texture of the canvas was rough .\n good .\n what else ?\n what were the subjects ?\n well ,  a lot of impressionist artists painted everyday scenes ,  like people on the streets and in cafes ,  uh ,  lots of nature scenes ,  especially landscapes .\n good .\n so when you go to the exhibit ,  i really want you to take a close look at a certain painting .\n it's a farm scene .\n and you will see it right as you enter the gallery .\n the reason i think this painting is so important is that it stresses the impressionist aspect of frantzen's style .\n it's an outdoor scene ,  an everyday scene .\n it's kind of bleak ,  but you can really see those broad brushstrokes and the blurry lines .\n the colors aren't quite realistic .\n the sky is kind of ,  well an unnatural pinkish yellow .\n and the fence in the foreground is blue ,  but somehow the overall scene gives an impression of a cold ,  bleak winter day on a farm .\n so that's the impressionist side of her work .\n oh ,  and speaking about farms ,  that reminds me .\n one interesting thing i read about franzten is that when she first moved back to iowa after living abroad ,  she often visited this place in her town called the sales barn .\n and the sales barn ,  it was basically this place where the local farmers bought and sold their cattle ,  their farm animals .\n and the reason frantzen went there ,  and she later on would visit other places like dance halls ,  was to observe people and the ways that they moved .\n she really found that this helped her work   that it gave her an understanding of body movements and actions ,  how humans move ,  and stand still ,  what their postures were like ,  too .\n so ,  what about realism ?\n what are the elements of realism we should be looking for in frantzen's work ?\n um  real honest depictions of subject matter ,  pretty unidealized stuff ,  and pretty everyday subject matter ,  too .\n good .\n one other painting i really want you to look at is of a young woman surrounded by pumpkins .\n you will notice that the woman's face is so realistic looking that it's almost like a photograph .\n the woman's nose is a little less than perfect and her hair is kind of messed up .\n this is realism .\n but then ,  the background of the painting ,  this woman with the pumpkins is wrapped in a blanket of broad thick brushstrokes ,  and ,  it's all kinds of zigzagging brushstrokes and lines ,  kind of chaotic almost when you look at it close .\n and there are vibrant colors .\n there's lots of orange ,  with little hints of an electric blue peeking out .\n i find frantzen to be a very accessible artist .\n i mean ,  some artists ,  to appreciate them ,  you have to know their life story .\n but here's a little bit about rose frantzen's life anyway .\n she attended art school ,  but was told by one of her instructors that she was not good at illustration ,  that she should go into advertising instead .\n so she took advertising classes and fine arts classes too ,  until she was convinced by the head of an advertising agency that her work was really good ,  that she could be an artist .\n but of course ,  it's not as easy as that ,  and so frantzen had to paint other people's portraits at places like art fairs just to make money to buy paint for her more serious art work .\n no matter what ,  she never stopped painting .\n and now ,  frantzen is doing extremely well .\n and her work is being shown all over the country .\n so i think most of us would be discouraged if we had to face challenges and difficulties like that .\n but what's important is that you keep at it that you don't give up .\n that's what is really important to remember .", "context_len": 964,

{"context": " ok ,  let's get started .\n great .\n today i want to talk about a way in which we are able to determine how old a piece of land ,  or some other geologic feature is   dating techniques .\n i'm going to talk about a particular dating technique .\n why ?\n good dating is key to good analysis .\n in other words ,  if you want to know how a land formation was formed ,  the first thing you probably want to know is how old it is .\n it's fundamental .\n uh  take the grand canyon for instance .\n now ,  we geologists thought we had a pretty good idea of how the grand canyon in the southwestern united states was formed .\n we knew that it was formed from sandstone that solidified somewhere between 15  and 3   million years ago .\n before it solidified ,  it was just regular sand .\n essentially it was part of a vast desert .\n and until just recently ,  most of us thought the sand had come from an ancient mountain range fairly close by that flattened out over time .\n that's been the conventional wisdom among geologists for quite some time .\n but now we've learned something different ,  and quite surprising ,  using a technique called uranium lead dating .\n i should say that uranium lead dating has been around for quite a while .\n but there have been some recent refinements .\n i will get into this in a minute .\n anyway ,  uranium lead dating has produced some surprises .\n two geologists discovered that about half of the sand from the grand canyon was actually once part of the appalachian mountains .\n that's really eye opening news ,  since the appalachian mountain range is ,  of course ,  thousands of kilometers to the east of the grand canyon .\n sounds pretty unbelievable ,  right ?\n of course ,  the obvious question is how did that sand end up so far west ?\n the theory is that huge rivers and wind carried the sand west where it mixed in with the sand that was already there .\n well ,  this was a pretty revolutionary finding .\n um  and it was basically because of uranium lead dating .\n why ?\n well ,  as everyone in this class should know ,  we usually look at the grain type within sandstone ,  meaning the actual particles in the sandstone ,  to determine where it came from .\n you can do other things too ,  like look at the wind or water that brought the grains to their location and figure out which way it was flowing .\n but that's only useful up to a point ,  and that's not what these two geologists did .\n uranium lead dating allowed them to go about it in an entirely different way .\n what they did was  they looked at the grains of zircon in the sandstone .\n zircon is a material that contains radioactive uranium ,  which makes it very useful for dating purposes .\n zircon starts off as molten magma ,  the hot lava from volcanoes .\n this magma then crystallizes .\n and when zircon crystallizes ,  the uranium inside it begins to change into lead .\n so if you measure the amount of lead in the zircon grain ,  you can figure out when the grain was formed .\n after that ,  you can determine the age of zircon from different mountain ranges .\n once you do that ,  you can compare the age of the zircon in the sandstone in your sample to the age of the zircon in the mountains .\n if the age of the zircon matches the age of one of the mountain ranges ,  then it means the sandstone actually used to be part of that particular mountain range .\n is everybody with me on that ?\n good .\n so ,  in this case ,  uranium lead dating was used to establish that half of the sandstone in the samples was formed at the same time the granite in the appalachian mountains was formed .\n so because of this ,  this new way of doing uranium lead dating ,  we've been able to determine that one of our major assumptions about the grand canyon was wrong .\n like i said before ,  uranium lead dating has been with us for a while .\n but ,  um  until recently ,  in order to do it ,  you really had to study many individual grains .\n and it took a long time before you got results .\n it just wasn't very efficient .\n and it wasn't very accurate .\n but technical advances have cut down on the number of grains you have to study ,  so you get your results faster .\n so i'll predict that uranium lead dating is going to become an increasingly popular dating method .\n there are a few pretty exciting possibilities for uranium lead dating .\n here is one that comes to mind .\n you know the theory that earth's continents were once joined together and only split apart relatively recently ?\n well ,  with uranium lead dating ,  we could prove that more conclusively .\n if they show evidence of once having been joined ,  that could really tell us a lot about the early history of the planet's geology .", "context_len": 912, "questions": ["Question: what does the professor mainly discuss?

{"context": " ok ,  we've been talking about early agriculture in the near east .\n so let's concentrate on one site and see what we can learn from it .\n let's look at catalhoyuk .\n um  i'd better write that down .\n catalhoyuk ,  that's about as close as we get in english .\n it's turkish ,  really .\n the site's in modern day turkey ,  and who knows what the original inhabitants called it .\n anyway ,  uh catalhoyuk wasn't the first agricultural settlement in the near east ,  but it was pretty early ,  settled about 9 ,     years ago in the neolithic period .\n and    um   the settlement  uh  town really ,  lasted about a thousand years and grew to a size of about eight or ten thousand people .\n that certainly makes it one of the largest towns in the world at that time .\n one of the things that make the settlement of this size impressive is the time period .\n it's the neolithic ,  remember ,  the late stone age .\n so the people that lived there had only stone tools ,  no metals .\n so everything they accomplished ,  like building this town ,  they did with just stone ,  plus wood ,  bricks ,  that sort of thing .\n but you got to remember that it wasn't just any stone they had ,  they had obsidian .\n and um   obsidian is a black ,  volcanic ,  well ,  almost like glass .\n it flakes very nicely into really sharp points .\n the sharpest tools of the entire stone age were made of obsidian .\n and uh   the people of catalhoyuk got theirs from further inland ,  from central turkey ,  traded for it ,  probably .\n anyway ,  what i wanna focus on is the way the town was built .\n the houses are all rectangular ,  one storey ,  made of sun dried bricks .\n but what's really interesting is that there are no spaces between them ,  no streets in other words ,  and so generally no doors on the houses either .\n people walked around on the roofs and entered the house through a hatchway on the roof ,  down a wooden ladder .\n you can still see the diagonal marks of the ladders in the plaster on the inside walls .\n once you were in the house ,  there would be one main room and a couple of small rooms for storage .\n the main room had the hearths ,  for cooking and for heat .\n it would've been pretty cold during the winters .\n and it also looks like they made their tools near the fire .\n there tends to be a lot of obsidian flakes and chips in the hearth ashes ,  but no chimney .\n the smoke just went out the same hatchway that people used for going in and out themselves .\n so there would have been an open fire inside the house with only one hole in the roof to let the smoke out .\n you and i would have found it a bit too smoky in there .\n you can see on the walls ,  which they plastered and decorated with paintings .\n they ended up with a layer of black soot on them ,  and so did people's lungs .\n the bones found in the graves show a layer of soot on the inside of the ribs .\n and that's another unusual feature of catalhoyuk ,  the burial sites .\n the graves have all been found under the houses ,  right under the floors .\n and it maybe this burial custom that explains why the houses were packed in so tightly without streets .\n i mean ,  you might think it was for protection or something ,  but there has been no evidence found yet of any violent attack that would indicate that kind of danger .\n it maybe they wanted to live as near as possible to their ancestors  graves and be buried near them themselves .\n but it makes a good point .\n based on excavations ,  we can know the layout of the houses and the location of the graves ,  but we're only guessing when we tried to say why they did it that way .\n that's the way it is with archeology .\n you are dealing with the physical remains that people left behind .\n we have no sure access to what they thought and how they felt about things .\n i mean it's interesting to speculate .\n and the physical artifacts can give us clues ,  but there is a lot we can't really know .\n so ,  for instance ,  their art .\n they painted on the plastered walls and usually they painted hunting scenes with wild animals in them .\n now they did hunt and they also raised cereal crops and kept sheep ,  but we don't know why so many of the paintings are of hunting scenes .\n was it supposed to have religious or magical significance ?\n that's the kind of thing we can only guess at based on clues .\n and hopefully ,  further excavation of catalhoyuk will yield more clues .\n but we'll probably never know for sure .", "context_len": 900, "questions": ["Question: what does the professor think of the idea that the inhabitants of catalhoyuk deliberately arranged their house so that they could live near their ancestors'sgraves?

{"context": " for today's discussion ,  we'll review the case study on how some animals have behaviorally adapted to their environments .\n now you had to read about two animal species ,  the eastern marmot and the olympic marmot .\n marmots are rodents .\n they are large ground squirrels ,  about the size of an average house cat .\n and they live in a variety of habitats .\n and even though they spend the significant portion of the year hibernating ,  according to this case study ,  marmots are still considered excellent subjects for animal behavioral studies .\n why is that ?\n well ,  when they are not hibernating ,  you can find them in open areas .\n and they are pretty active during the day ,  which makes them easy to observe ,  right ?\n uh huh ,  so first let's discuss the eastern marmots .\n they reside throughout the eastern region of north america where there is a temperate climate ,  where the growing season lasts for at least five months of the year ,  which is when they do all their mating ,  playing and eating .\n oh ,  i see .\n at first i wasn't sure what growing season meant ,  just from the reading .\n but now i get it .\n it's the amount of time it takes for them to grow ,  right ?\n so it would be five months ?\n umm ?\n oh ,  uh  i'm sorry but no .\n it has nothing to do with that .\n it's not about the time it takes for eastern marmots to grow .\n it's when the food is available .\n that is when it's not covered in snow and there is no frost covering the grass and ,  umm ,  vegetative parts of a plant's herbs and the flowers the marmots like to eat .\n so growing season refers to the availability of the food they eat ,  ok ?\n so now how would you describe the eastern marmots  social habits ?\n well ,  they are really territorial ,  and loners ,  and just so aggressive even with other eastern marmots .\n and their mating ritual is just so impersonal .\n uh huh ?\n now when they emerge in the spring from hibernation ,  the mating process begins .\n for them ,  well ,  they come together to mate and then they go their separate ways .\n then about six to eight weeks after birth ,  the offspring leave their mothers .\n really ?\n just six weeks ?\n is that possible for the offspring to make it on their own so young ?\n well ,  it's not as if they aren't ready for the real world because they are .\n remember ,  they mature quickly and the weather's nice .\n also they live in open fields where there is lots of edible vegetation .\n so roughly six weeks after birth ,  eastern marmots are just old enough to take their chances of surviving in the temperate environment .\n so how does this relate to their behavior ?\n oh ,  i get it .\n since the climate's not too bad ,  the eastern marmots don't have to rely on each other too much and they really don't need to stay together as a family to survive either .\n uh ha .\n any contrast ,  the olympic marmots ?\n what about them ?\n well ,  they live together as a family and take care of their young until they are at least two years old .\n they're really friendly with each other .\n and what i really like is that they even have greeting ceremonies .\n and they are not at all aggressive and territorial like the eastern marmots .\n so their social behavior is so different from eastern marmots because of the climate where they live ?\n that seems so bizarre .\n well ,  the olympic marmots inhabit meadows high in the olympic mountains where the weather conditions are much harsher .\n so there is a lot more wind and snow .\n the growing season only lasts about two to three months .\n so in that much shorter period of time ,  all the olympic marmots ,  male and female ,  eat ,  play ,  work and nurture the young together .\n because the climate is so harsh ,  cooperation increases the survival rate of the olympic marmots .\n they keep their young at home until they are physically able to survive on their own .\n this could explain why the social behavior of the olympic marmots is so unlike that of the eastern marmots .", "context_len": 785, "questions": ["Question: what is the main topic of the lecture?

{"context": " so we've been talking about nutrients ,  the elements in the environment that are essential for living organisms to develop ,  live a healthy life and reproduce .\n some nutrients are quite scarce  there just isn't much of them in the environment .\n but fortunately they get recycled .\n when nutrients are used over and over in the environment ,  we call that a nutrient cycle .\n because of the importance of nutrients and their scarcity ,  nutrient recycling is one of the most significant eco system processes that we'll cover in this course .\n the three most important nutrient recycles are the nitrogen cycle ,  the carbon cycle and the one we are going to talk about today ,  the phosphorus cycle .\n so the phosphorus cycle has been studied a lot by ecologists because like i said ,  phosphorus is an important nutrient and it's not so abundant .\n the largest quantities are found in rocks and at the bottom of the ocean .\n how does phosphorus get there ?\n well ,  let's start with the phosphorus in rocks .\n the rocks get broken down into smaller and smaller particles as they are weathered .\n they are weathered slowly by rain and wind over long periods of time .\n phosphorus is slowly released as the rocks are broken down and it gets spread around into the soil .\n once it's in the soil ,  plants absorb it through their roots .\n so that's the reason people mine rocks that contain a lot of phosphorus to help with agriculture ?\n uh huh ,  they mined the rock ,  artificially break it down and put the phosphorus into agricultural fertilizers .\n so humans can play a role in the first part of the phosphorus cycle    the breaking down of rocks and the spreading of phosphorus into the soil by speeding up the rate at which this natural process occurs .\n you see .\n now after the phosphorus is in the soil ,  plants grow .\n they use phosphorus from the soil to grow .\n and when they die ,  they decompose .\n and the phosphorus is recycled back into the soil  same thing with the animals that eat those plants ,  or eat other animals that have eaten those plants .\n we call all of this   the land phase of the phosphorus cycle .\n but a lot of the phosphorus in soil gets washed away into rivers by rain and melting snow .\n and so begins another phase of the cycle .\n can anyone guess what it is called ?\n nancy ?\n well ,  if the one is called the land phase ,  then this has to be called the water phase ,  right ?\n yes ,  that's such a difficult point isn't it ?\n in a normal water phase ,  rivers eventually empty into oceans ,  and once in the oceans ,  the phosphorus gets absorbed by water plants like algae .\n then fish eats the algae or eat other fish that have eaten those plants .\n but the water phase is sometime affected by excessive fertilizers .\n if not all of phosphorus gets used by the crops and large amounts of phosphorus gets into the rivers .\n this could cause rapid growth of water plants in the river ,  which can lead to the water ways getting clogged with organisms ,  which can change the flow of the water .\n several current studies are looking at these effects and i really do hope we can find a way to deal with this issue before these ecosystems are adversely affected .\n ok ?\n of course ,  another way that humans can interrupt the normal process is fishing .\n the fishing industry helps bring phosphorus back to land .\n in the normal water phase the remaining phosphorus makes its way ,  settles to the bottom of the ocean and gets mixed into ocean sediments .\n but remember ,  this is a cycle .\n the phosphorus at the bottom of the ocean has to somehow make its way back to the surface ,  to complete the cycle ,  to begin the cycle all over again .\n after millions of years ,  powerful geological forces ,  like underwater volcanoes lift up the ocean sediments to form new land .\n when an underwater volcano pushes submerged rock to the surface ,  a new island is created .\n then over many more years the phosphorus rich rocks of the new land begin to erode and the cycle continues .\n what about ,  well ,  you said that the nitrogen cycle is also an important nutrient cycle .\n and there is a lot of nitrogen in the atmosphere ,  so i was wondering ,  is there a lot of phosphorus in the atmosphere too ?\n good question ,  george .\n you're right to guess that phosphorus can end up in earth's atmosphere .\n it can move from the land or from the oceans to the atmosphere ,  and vice versa .\n however ,  there's just not a substantial amount of it there ,  like there is with nitrogen ,  it's a very minimal quantity .", "context_len": 873, "questions": ["Question: what comparison does the professor make involving phosphorus and nitrogen?

{"context": " today ,  we are taking a little detour from the grand styles of public architecture we've been studying to look at residential architectures in the united states .\n since this is something we can all identify with ,  i think it will help us see the relationship between the function of a structure and its style or form .\n this has been an ongoing theme in our discussions ,  and we will be getting back to it in just a moment .\n but before we get started ,  i want you to take a moment to think  does anyone know what the single most popular style for a house in the united states is today ?\n bob ?\n i bet it is the ranch style house .\n well ,  in this area ,  probably .\n but are we typical ?\n yes ,  sue .\n how about the kind of house my grandparents live in ?\n they call it a capethat's the one .\n here is a drawing of what we consider of a classic cape cod house .\n these days ,  you see this style all over the united states .\n but it first showed up in u .\n 's .\n northeast ,  in the new england region ,  around the late 16 's .\n for those of you who don't know the northeast coastal region ,  cape cod is a peninsula ,  a narrow strip of land that jets out into the atlantic ,  and so    so ,  many houses in this particular style were built on cape cod ,  that the name of the place became the name of the style .\n now why did the cape cod style house become so popular in the northeast ?\n well ,  one reason is that it's a great example of form following function .\n we've talked about this design principle a lot about form following function .\n and what did we say it meant ?\n someone give me an application of this principle .\n what is this concept that form should follow function ?\n how would it be applied to housing design ?\n well ,  if it means that the design of a building should be based on the needs of the people who use it .\n then ,  well ,  the architect has to be very practical to think about the people who'll actually be living in the house or working in the office building ,  whatever ,  so for the architect ,  it's all about the users not about showing off how creative you can be .\n good ,  of course ,  for a cape cod house ,  it might be even more accurate to say that form also follows climate .\n who knows what the climate's like on cape cod ?\n and whenever i visit my grandparents ,  it's really wet .\n it's usually either raining or snowing or foggy and windy ,  too .\n i guess because it's so exposed to the ocean ?\n that's right .\n so take another look at this drawing ,  and you can imagine how this design might be particularly helpful in that kind of climate .\n notice how the house sits fairly low to the ground .\n this relatively low compact structure helps the house withstand the strong winds blowing off the ocean .\n slope of the roof ,  the steep angle helps keep off all that rain and snow that accumulates in the winter .\n another thing ,  cape cod houses usually face south to take advantage of the sun's warm through the windows .\n that's helpful in winter .\n now what can you tell me about the chimney ,  about its location ?\n well ,  it's in the middle .\n because ,  does that have something to do with heating the houses ?\n i mean since the heat never has to travel very far .\n that'd mean you can heat the house more efficiently ,  right ?\n exactly ,  now see how the house has very little exterior decoration ,  that's also typical of early cape cod houses .\n the wind was one reason ,  nothing sticking out that might blow away in the harsh weather ,  but there was probably another reason ,  not related to the climate ,  more a reflection of rural new england society back then ,  you see cape cod houses were not built in the big cities ,  where all the rich people lived back then .\n these were modest dwellings ,  the people who built them simply couldn't afford lots of expensive decorative details .\n but it was more than just a matter of money .\n in these rural areas ,  people depended on each other for survival .\n neighbors had to help and support each other in a difficult environment ,  so you didn't want to appear to be showing off .\n you'd want to avoid anything that might set you apart from your neighbors ,  the same people you might need to help you someday .\n so all these help to create an attitude of conformity in the community ,  and you can see why a modest ,  a very plain style would have become so widely imitated throughout rural new england .\n it is plain ,  but you know its nice looking .\n good point ,  and in fact it's precisely that aesthetic appeal ,  the the purity ,  the nearly perfect proportions of the house that's another reason for the cape cod's enduring popularity ,  even in places where the climate is so mild that its functional design doesn't matter .", "context_len": 958, "questions": ["Question: what aspect of architecture in the united states is the lecture mainly about?

potential customers .\n does a systematic advertising plan look like ?\n well ,  it covers what we call    the  four ms  .\n the  four ms   market ,  media ,  money ,  message .\n all are important areas to focus on when creating your advertising plan .\n we will look at them one by one .\n the first step is to look at your market ,  that's the people who might become customers ,  buyers of your service or product .\n you need to know all about your possible customers  who are they  what age group are they ?\n what do they like ,  or dislike ?\n how do they shop ?\n so ,  you got that ?\n a market is a group of potential customers .\n next ,  media  obviously the major media are television ,  radio ,  newspapers ,  magazines ,  um ,  billboards ,  and so forth .\n there are all avenues of communication .\n and you need to figure out  which media you should advertise through ?\n which media will reach your intended audience    your market ?\n so ,  you do research ,  trying to determine which media will reach the most potential customers for the lowest cost .\n for instance ,  if you have a product ,  that    oh   say teachers would like ,  then teachers are your market .\n so you ask yourself  what magazines do the majority of teachers read ?\n what tv programs do teachers watch ?\n do teachers listen to much radio ?\n at what times of the day ?\n say ,  now your research turns up two magazines that teachers read .\n and it also shows that the majority of teachers   say ages twenty to thirty   read the magazine about classroom activities .\n while most teachers older than that read the other magazine ,  the one about ,  oh ,  let's say  educational psychology  .\n you think your product will appeal most to teachers ages twenty to thirty ,  so you decide to put your advertisement in their favorite magazine ,  the one about classroom activities .\n you don't waste money advertising in the  educational psychology  magazine ,  you know the one that the younger teachers generally don't read .\n and since you're reaching the majority of the teachers in your target age group ,  you're probably spending your money well ,  which bring us to the third'm    money .\n you have an advertising budget to spend ,  but how do you to spend it wisely .\n again ,  research is the key .\n good research gives you facts ,  facts that can help you decide ,  well ,  as we already mentioned ,  decide the right market to target ,  and the best media to use .\n but also  when to advertise ?\n or or how to get the best rates ?\n like ,  maybe you're advertising sports equipment ,  and you have been spending most of your budget during the holiday season when people buy gifts for each other .\n now ,  in theory ,  that would seem a great time to advertise ,  but maybe research shows that you're wrong ,  that the customers who buy sports equipment tend not to give it as a holiday gift ,  but want to use it themselves .\n in that case ,  advertising during a different season of the year might give you better results .\n and ,  um ,  maybe at even lower ,  non holiday rates ,  so you actually save money .\n but you need to get the facts  facts that come from good research to be certain and know for sure that you're getting your money's worth .\n ok ,  finally ,  there is your message  what you want to say about your product ?\n why buying it will make the customer's life easier ,  or safer or better somehow .\n whatever the message is ,  make sure you get it right .\n let me give you an example of not getting it right ,  ha  ha  ha   you are going to love this one  there was this soup shop ,  the soup was really tasty ,  but there weren't a lot of customers .\n the owner thought that maybe if they gave something away for free with each purchase ,  then more people would come buy soup .\n so they got some cheap socks ,  and they advertised to give a pair away with each bowl of soup .\n but ,  then even fewer people came to the restaurant .\n well ,  you can imagine why .\n people started to associate the soup with feet  they began to imagine the soup smelled like feet .\n the advertising message ,  soup means free socks ,  was a bad choice  it was a waste of money .\n and worse ,  it caused the loss of customers .\n now ,  i want everyone to get into small groups and come up with some examples ,  not of good advertising messages ,  but of truly disastrous ones .\n think of real examples or make some up ,  and talk about the reasons those messages are unsuccessful .\n and then we'll get back together

{"context": " as we learn more about the dna in human cells and how it controls the growth and development of cells ,  then maybe we can explain a very important observation ,  that when we try to grow most human cells in a laboratory ,  they seem programmed to divide only a certain number of times before they die .\n now this differs with the type of cell .\n some cells ,  like nerve cells ,  only divide seven to nine times in their total life .\n others ,  like skin cells ,  will divide many ,  many more times .\n but finally the cells stop renewing themselves and they die .\n and in the cells of the human body itself ,  in the cells of every organ ,  of almost every type of tissue in the body ,  the same thing will happen eventually .\n ok ,  you know that all of a person's genetic information is contained on very long pieces of dna called chromosomes .\n 46 of them are in the human cells ,  that's 23 pairs of these chromosomes of various lengths and sizes .\n now if you'll look at this rough drawing of one of them ,  one chromosome about to divide into two .\n you see that it sort of looks like ,  well actually it's much more complex than this ,  but it reminds us a couple of springs linked together ,  two coiled up pieces of dna .\n and if you stretch them out you will find they contain certain genes ,  certain sequences of dna that help determine how the cells of the body will develop .\n when researchers look really carefully at the dna in chromosomes though ,  they were amazed ,  we all were ,  to find that only a fraction of it ,  maybe 2  3   ,  converts into meaningful genetic information .\n it's incredible  at least it was to me .\n but if you took away all the dna that codes for genes ,  you still have maybe 7   of the dna left over .\n that's the so called junk dna .\n though the word junk is used sort of tongue in cheek .\n the assumption is that even if this dna doesn't make up any of the genes ,  it must serve some other purpose .\n anyway ,  if we examine these ends of these coils of dna ,  we will find a sequence of dna at each end of every human chromosome ,  called a telomere .\n now a telomere is a highly repetitious and genetically meaningless sequence of dna ,  what we were calling junk dna .\n but it does have an important purpose  it is sort of like the plastic tip on each end of a shoelace .\n it may not help you tie your shoe but that little plastic tip keeps the rest of the shoelace ,  the shoe string from unraveling into weak and useless threads .\n well ,  the telomeres at the ends of chromosomes seem to do about the same thing    protect the genes ,  the genetically functional parts of the chromosome ,  from being damaged .\n every time the chromosome divides ,  every time one cell divides into two .\n pieces of the ends of the chromosome ,  the telomeres ,  get broken off .\n so after each division ,  the telomeres get shorter and one of the things that may happen after a while is that pieces of the genes themselves get broken off the chromosomes .\n so the chromosome is now losing important genetic information and is no longer functional .\n but as long as the telomeres are a certain length ,  they keep this from happening .\n so it seems that ,  when the ,  by looking at the length of the telomeres on specific chromosomes ,  we can actually predict pretty much how long certain cells can successfully go on dividing .\n now ,  there are some cells that just seem to keep on dividing regardless ,  which may not always be a good thing if it gets out of control .\n but when we analyze these cells chemically ,  we find something very interesting ,  a chemical in them ,  an enzyme called telomerase .\n as bits of the telomere break off from the end of the chromosome ,  this chemical ,  this telomerase can rebuild it ,  can help reassemble the protective dna ,  the telomere that the chromosome has lost .\n someday we may be able to take any cell and keep it alive functioning and reproducing itself essentially forever through the use of telomerase .\n and in the future we may have virtually immortal nerve cells and immortal skin cells or whatever ,  because this chemical ,  telomerase ,  can keep the telomeres on the ends of chromosomes from getting any shorter .", "context_len": 819, "questions": ["Question: what does the professor imply about the length of the telomeres on a cell's chromosomes?

{"context": " ok ,  as we've talked about a key aspect of running a successful business is knowing ,  um ,  getting a good sense of what the customer actually wants ,  and how they perceive your product .\n so with that in mind ,  i want to describe a very simple method of researching customer preference ,  and it is becoming increasingly common ,  it's called    mbwa    which stands for managing by wandering around .\n now ,  mbwa ,  that's not the most technical sounding name you've ever heard ,  but it describes the process pretty accurately .\n here is how it works .\n basically ,  um ,  the idea is that business owners or business managers just go out and actually talk to their customers ,  and learn more about how well the business is serving their needs ,  and try to see what the customer experiences ,  because that's a great way to discover for yourself ,  how your product is perceived ,  what its strengths and weaknesses are ,  you know ,  how you can improve it   that sort of thing .\n you know dortans ,  they make soup and canned vegetables and such .\n well ,  the head of the company had dortans  top executives walk around supermarkets ,  um ,  asking shoppers what they thought of dortans  soups ,  and he used that data to make changes to the company's product ,  i mean ,  when dortans of all the companies ,  embraces something as radical as mbwa ,  it really shows you how popular the theory has become ,  yes ,  lisa ?\n but isn't it dangerous to base decisions on information from a small sample of people ?\n isn't large scale market research safer getting data on a lot of people ?\n that's a good question ,  and well i don't want to pretend that w  mbwa is some sort of ,  um ,  replacement for other methods of customer research .\n now ,  market research data definitely can give you a good idea of ,  um ,  of the big picture ,  but mbwa is really useful ,  it kind of filling in the blanks ,  you know ,  getting a good underground sense of how your products are used ,  and how people need to respond to them ,  and yes ,  the numbers of opinion you get is small so you do need to be careful ,  but ,  good business managers will tell you that the big fear they have and    .\n and one of the most frequent problems they come across is well becoming out of touch with what their customers really want and need ,  you know ,  surveys and market research stuff like that ,  they can only tell you so much about what the customers actually want in their day to day lives .\n managing by wandering around ,  on the other hand ,  well ,  that gets you in there and gives you a good sense of what customers need .\n so    so when using combination then ,  mbwa and market research ,  well ,  they are powerful tools .\n oh ,  here is another example for you ,  uh ,  senior executives for a clothing manufacturer .\n it was ,  um ,  lken ,  lken jeans you know ,  they went and worked in a store for a few days ,  selling lken's cloths .\n now that gave them a very different idea about their product ,  they saw how people responded to it  they could go up to customers in the store and ask them questions about it ,  uh ,  yes mike ?\n well ,  i would think that a lot of customers would be bothered by ,  you know ,  if i'm shopping ,  i don't know if i'd want some business representative coming up to me and asking me questions ,  it's   it's like when i get phone calls at home from market researchers ,  i just hang up on them professor oh ,  well ,  it's certainly true that well no one likes getting calls at home from market researchers or people like that ,  but i will tell you something .\n most customers have the exact opposite reaction when it comes to mbwa .\n now ,  don't ask me why ,  because i really have no idea ,  but the fact is that customers tend to respond really well to mbwa ,  which is the key reason for its success .\n in fact ,  the techniques of mbwa work so well ,  they have actually been extended to all kinds of different contexts ,  like politics for instance ,  um ,  a few years back ,  the mayor of baltimore ,  um   i think his name was sheaffer or something like that .\n anyway ,  he decided that the best way to serve the people of the city ,  of his city ,  was to actually get out there in it and experience the things that they experienced ,  so he'd ride around the city in ,  well ,  you know ,  in all parts of it ,  and he'd see all the potholes  he'd see how the trash was sometimes ,  um ,  not picked up off the side of the street and then he'd go back to his office and he'd write these memos ,  now they were memos to his staff about the problems he had seen ,  and how they needed to be fixed ,  you know that sort of thing ,  but the thing is he got all this information just by going around and seeing the different baltimore neighborhoods and talking to the people in them .\n now he called it    smart politics ,  we'd call it mbwa ,  or just ,

{"context": " in the last 5  years or so ,  many american cities have had difficulties in maintaining a successful retail environment .\n business owners in the city centers or the downtown areas have experienced some financial losses ,  because of a steady movement of people out of the cities and into the suburbs .\n in general ,  downtown areas ,  just don't have that many residential areas ,  not that many people live there .\n so what have city planners decided to do about it ?\n well ,  one way they've come up with some ways to attract more people ,  to shop downtown was by creating pedestrian malls .\n now ,  what is a pedestrian mall ?\n it's a pretty simple concept really ,  it is essentially an outdoor shopping area designed just for people on foot .\n and  well ,  unlike many other shopping malls that are built in the suburbs nowadays ,  these pedestrian malls are typically located in the downtown area of the city .\n and  oh   there are features like white sidewalks ,  comfortable outdoor seating and maybe even fountains ,  and   you know ,  art .\n there are variations on this model of course ,  but the common denominator is always the idea of creating a shopping space that will get people to shop in the city without needing their cars .\n so i am sure you can see how having an area that's off limits to automobile traffic would be ideal for a heavily populated city where ,  well ,  the streets would otherwise be bustling with noisy ,  unpleasant traffic congestion .\n concept which originated in europe was adopted by american city planners in the late 195's .\n and since then ,  a number of unites states  cities have created pedestrian malls .\n and many of them have been highly successful .\n so what have city planners learned about making these malls succeed ?\n well ,  there are two critical factors to consider when creating a pedestrian mall    location and design .\n both of which are equally important .\n now let's start with the location .\n in choosing a specific location for a pedestrian mall ,  there are in fact two considerations .\n proximity to potential customers ,  um that's we'd call a customer base and accessibility to public transportation which we will get to in just a moment .\n now ,  for a customer base ,  the most obvious example would be a large office building since the employees could theoretically go shopping after work or during their lunch hour ,  right ?\n another really good example is convention center which typically has a hotel and large meeting spaces to draw visitors to the city for major business conferences and events .\n but ideally ,  the pedestrian mall would be used by local residents ,  not just people working in the city or visiting the area .\n so that's where access to public transportation comes in ,  either   um  either the designers plan to locate the mall near a central transportation hub ,  like a bus terminal ,  a major train or subway station or they work with city officials to create sufficient parking areas ,  not too far from the mall ,  which makes sense because if people can't drive into the mall area ,  well ,  then they need to have easy access to it .\n ok ,  so that's location ,  but    but what about design ?\n well ,  design doesn't necessarily include things like sculptures or decorative walkways or  or even eye catching window displays ,  you know ,  art .\n although i would be the first to admit those things are aesthetically appealing ,  however ,  visually pleasing sights ,  well ,  they are not a part of the pedestrian mall design that matter than most .\n the key consideration is a compact and convenient layout .\n one which allows pedestrians to walk from one end of the mall to the other in just a few minutes ,  so they can get to the major stores ,  resaurants and other central places without having to take more than one or two turns .\n now ,  this takes careful and creative planning .\n but now what if one ingredient to this planning recipe is missing ?\n there could quite possibly be long lasting effects .\n and i think a good example is the pedestrian mall in the louisville kentucky for instance .\n now when the louisville mall was built ,  oh ,  it had lots of visual appeal ,  it was attractively designed ,  right in the small part of downtown and it pretty much possessed all of the other design elements for success .\n but    uh ,  now ,  here is where my point about location comes into play .\n there wasn't a convention center around to    to help draw in visitors ,  and well ,  the only nearby hotel eventually closed down for that same reason .\n well ,  you can imagine how this must have affected local and pedestrian mall business owners .\n sort of what was we call a chain reaction .\n it wasn't until a convention center and a parking garage were built about a decade later that the mall started to be successful .", "context_len": 896, "questions": ["Question: why does the professor

{"context": " ok ,  so the two poems we are looking at today fall into the category of    uh    medievaltimes ,  which was how long ago ?\n almost a thousand years ago ,  right ?\n but ,  professor ,  are you sure these are poems ?\n i mean i thought poems were shorter  these are more like long stories .\n i mean one of them was all about love ,  but the other one ,  the chan chan whatever it's called ,  the other one  well ,  it was all about fighting and battles .\n i mean can both of them be considered poems ?\n well ,  think back to the very beginning of this course .\n remember how we ,  we define poetry ?\n in the very broadest sense ,  we said it's written to evoke ,  to make you ,  the audience ,  have some kind of the emotional experience through the use of imagery ,  um ,  some kind of predictable rhythm .\n and usually ,  but not always ,  there's more than one meaning implied with the words that are used .\n let's start with the chanson poetry first .\n that's chanson .\n chanson poems became popular in europe ,  particularly in france ,  and the term is actually short for a longer french phrase that translates to um    uh  songs of deeds .\n now ,  they were called songs of deeds because strangely enough ,  they were written to describe the heroic deeds or actions of warriors ,  the knights during conflicts .\n we don't know a lot about the authors ,  it's still contested somewhat .\n but we are pretty sure about who the chanson poems were written for .\n that is   they were written for knights and the lords   the nobility that they served .\n the poems were sung ,  performed by a minstrel ,  a singer who travelled from castle to castle ,  singing to the local lord and his knights .\n uh  well ,  would someone summarize the main features of the chanson poem you read ?\n well ,  there's a hero ,  a knight ,  who goes to battle ,  and he is admired for his courage ,  bravery and loyalty ,  loyalty to the lord he serves ,  his country and his fellow warriors in the field .\n he's    .\n um   he has a ,  he's a skilled fighter ,  willing to face the most extreme dangers ,  sacrificial ,  willing to sacrifice anything and everything to protect his king and country .\n ok ,  now ,  given that the intended audience for these poems were knights and lords .\n what can we say about the purpose of chanson poetry ?\n what kinds of feelings was it meant to provoke ?\n i guess they must've been really appealing to those knights and lords who were listening to them .\n hearing the songs probably made them feel more patriotic ,  made them feel like it was a good and noble thing to serve their countries in whatever way they could .\n good ,  we've got a pretty good picture of what the chanson hero was like .\n now let's compare that to the hero in the other poem .\n the other poem is an example of what's called romance poetry .\n and the hero in the romance poem was also a knight .\n but what made the knight in romance poetry different from the knight in chanson poetry ?\n well ,  first the purpose of the hero's actions was different .\n the hero in romance poetry is independent ,  purely solitary in a way ,  not like the chanson poet who was always surrounded by his fighting companions .\n he doesn't engage in conflict to protect his lord or country .\n he does it for the sake of adventure ,  to improve himself ,  to show he's worthy of respect and love from his lady .\n he's very conscious of the particular rules of social behavior he has to live up to somehow .\n and all of his actions are for the purpose of proving that he is an upright ,  moral ,  well mannered ,  well behaved individual .\n you may have noticed that in chanson poetry ,  there isn't much about the hero's feelings .\n the focus is on the actions ,  the deeds .\n but the romance poetry describes a lot of the inner feelings ,  the motivations ,  psychology you could say ,  of a knight trying to improve himself ,  to better himself ,  so that he's worthy of the love of a woman .\n what explains this difference ?\n well ,  uh ,  digging into the historical context tells us a lot .\n romance poetry emerged a few generations after chanson ,  and its roots were in geographic regions of france that were calmer ,  where conflict wasn't central to people's lives .\n more peaceful times meant there was more time for education ,  travel ,  more time for reflection .\n another name for romance poetry that's often synonymous with it is troubadour poetry .\n troubadours were the authors of these new romance poems .\n and we know a lot more about the troubadours than we do about the chanson authors ,  because they often had small biographical sketches added to their poems that gave pretty specific information about their social status ,  geographical location and a small outline of their career .\n these information wasn't particularly reliable because they were sometimes based on fictitious stories of great adventure or scraped together from parts of different poems .\n but there is enough there to squeeze or infer some facts about their social class .\n the political climate had settled down enough so that troubadours had the luxury of being able to spend most if not all of their time ,  creating ,  crafting or composing their love songs for their audiences .\n and yes these poems were also sung  many troubadours were able to make a living being full time poets which should tell you something about the value of that profession during medieval times .", "context_len": 1045, "questions": ["Question: what does the

{"context": " we've said that the term  cognition  refers to mental states like  knowing and believing ,  and to mental processes that we use to arrive at those states .\n so for example ,  reasoning is a cognitive process ,  so is perception .\n we use information that we perceive through our senses to help us make decisions ,  to arrive at beliefs and so on .\n and then there are memory and imagination which relate to the knowledge of things that happen in the past or may happen in the future .\n so perceiving ,  remembering ,  imagining are all internal mental processes that lead to knowing or believing .\n yet ,  each of these processes has limitations and can lead us to hold mistaken beliefs or make false predictions .\n take memory for example ,  maybe you have heard of studies in which people hear a list of related words .\n um  ,  let's say a list of different kinds of fruit .\n after hearing this list ,  they are presented with several additional words .\n in this case ,  we'll say the additional words were  blanket  and  cherry  .\n neither of these words was on the original list ,  and while people will claim correctly that  blanket  was not on the original list ,  they'll also claim incorrectly that the word  cherry  was on the list .\n most people are convinced they heard the word  cherry  on the original list .\n why did they make such a simple mistake ?\n well ,  we think because the words on the list were so closely related ,  the brain stored only the gist of what it heard .\n for example ,  that all the items on the list were types of fruit .\n when we tap our memory ,  our brains often fill in details and quite often these details are actually false .\n we also see this  fill in  phenomenon with perception .\n perception is the faculty that allows us to process information in the present as we take it in via our senses .\n again ,  studies have shown that people will fill in information that they thought they perceived even when they didn't .\n for example ,  experiments have been done where a person hears a sentence ,  but it is missing the word that logically completes it .\n they'll claim to hear that word even though it was never said .\n so if i were to say er the sun rises in the and then fail to complete the sentence ,  people will often claim to have heard the word  east  .\n in cognitive psychology ,  we have a phrase for this kind of inaccurate  filling in of details     it's called  a blind spot .\n the term originally refers to the place in our eyes where the optic nerve connects the back of the eye to the brain .\n there are no photoreceptors in the area where the nerve connects to the eye .\n so that particular area of the eye is incapable of detecting images .\n it produces  a blind spot  in our field of vision .\n we aren't aware of it ,  because the brain fills in what it thinks belongs in the image ,  so the picture always appears complete to us .\n but the term  blind spot  has also taken on a more general meaning    it refers to people being unaware of a bias that may affect their judgment about a subject .\n and the same  blind spot phenomenon  that affects memory and perception also affects imagination .\n imagination is a faculty that some people use to anticipate future events in their lives .\n but the ease with which we imagine details can lead to unrealistic expectations and can bias our decisions .\n so um peter ,  suppose i ask you to imagine a lunch salad ,  no problem ,  right ?\n but i bet you imagine specific ingredients .\n did yours have tomatoes ,  onion ,  lettuce ?\n mine did .\n our brains fill in all sorts of details that might not be part of other people's image of a salad ,  which could lead to disappointment for us .\n if the next time we order a salad in a restaurant ,  we have our imagined salad in mind ,  that's not necessarily what we'll get on our plate .\n the problem is not that we imagine things ,  but that we assume what we've imagined is accurate .\n we should be aware that our imagination has this built in feature ,  the blind spot ,  which makes our predictions fall short of reality .", "context_len": 785, "questions": ["Question: what point does the professor make about imagination?

{"context": " almost all animals have some way of regulating their body temperature  otherwise they wouldn't survive extreme hot or cold conditions   sweating ,  panting ,  swimming to cooler or warmer water  ducking into somewhere cool like a burrow or a hole under a rock  these are just a few .\n and that spot is colder or warmer than the surrounding environment ,  because it's a microclimate .\n a microclimate is a group of climate conditions that affect a localized area ,  weather features like temperature ,  wind ,  moisture and so on .\n and when i say localized ,  i mean really localized ,  because microclimates can be ,  as the name suggests ,  pretty small ,  even less than a square meter .\n and microclimates are affected by huge number of other variables .\n obviously weather conditions in the surrounding area are a factor .\n but other aspects of the location like ,  um  the elevation of the land ,  the plant life nearby ,  and so on ,  have a substantial effect on microclimates .\n and of course the human development in the area ,  um ,  a road will affect a nearby microclimate .\n it's also interesting to note that microclimates that are near each other can have very different conditions .\n in the forest for example ,  there can be a number of very different microclimates close to each other ,  because of all the variables i just mentioned .\n so how does a hole in the ground ,  a burrow ,  stay cool in a hot climate ?\n well ,  since cold air sinks ,  and these spots are shaded ,  they are usually much cooler than the surrounding area .\n and these spots are so important because many animals rely on microclimates to regulate their body temperature .\n um ,  for instance ,  there is a species of squirrel ,  in the western part of the united states that can get really hot when they are out foraging for food .\n so they need a way to cool down .\n so what do they do ?\n they go back to their own burrow .\n once they get there ,  their body temperatures decrease very ,  very quickly .\n the trip to the burrow prevents the squirrel from getting too hot .\n but squirrels are mammals ,  right ?\n i thought mammals regulated their temperaturemammals do have the ability to regulate their body temperature ,  but not all can do it to the same degree ,  or even the same way .\n like when you walk outside on a hot day ,  you perspire ,  and your body cools itself down ,  a classic example of how a mammal regulates its own body temperature .\n but one challenge that squirrels face ,  well many small mammals do ,  is that because of their size ,  sweating would make them lose too much moisture .\n they dehydrate .\n but on the other hand ,  their small size allows them to fit into very tiny spaces .\n so for small mammals ,  microclimates can make a big difference .\n they rely on microclimates for survival .\n so cold blooded animals ,  like reptiles ,  they can't control their own body temperature ,  so i can imagine the effect a microclimate would have on them .\n yes ,  many reptiles and insects rely on microclimates to control their body temperature .\n a lot of reptiles use burrows or stay under rocks to cool down .\n of course with reptiles ,  it's a balancing act .\n staying in the heat for too long can lead to problems ,  but staying in the cold can do the same .\n so reptiles have to be really precise about where they spend their time ,  even how they position their bodies .\n and when i say they're precise ,  i mean it    some snakes will search out a place under rocks of a specific thickness ,  because too thin a rock doesn't keep them cool enough ,  and too thick a rock will cause them to get too cold .\n that level of precision is critical to the snake for maintaining its body temperature .\n and even microscopic organisms rely on microclimates for survival .\n think about this ,  decomposing leaves create heat that warms the soil  the warm soil in turn affects the growth ,  the conditions of organisms there .\n and those organisms then affect the rate of decomposition of the leaves .\n so a microclimate can be something so small and so easily disturbed that even a tiny change can have a big impact .\n if someone on a hike knocks a couple of rocks over ,  they could be unwittingly destroying a microclimate that an animal or organism relies on .", "context_len": 809, "questions": ["Question: what is the lecture mainly about?

{"context": " ok ,  last time we talked about ancient agricultural civilizations that observed the stars and then used those observations to keep track of the seasons .\n but today i want to talk about the importance of stars for early seafarers ,  about how the fixed patterns of stars were used as navigational aids .\n ok ,  you've all heard about the vikings and their impressive navigation skills ,  but the seafaring peoples of the pacific islands ,  the polynesians and the micronesians ,  were quite possibly the world's greatest navigators .\n long before the development of ,  uh ,  advanced navigational tools in europe ,  pacific islanders were travelling from new zealand to hawaii and back again ,  using nothing but the stars as their navigational instruments .\n um ,  the key to the pacific islanders  success was probably their location near the equator .\n what that meant was that the sky could be partitioned ,  divided up ,  much more symmetrically than it could farther away from the equator .\n unlike the vikings ,  early observers of the stars in polynesia or really anywhere along the equator would feel that they were at the very center of things ,  with the skies to the north and the skies to the south behaving identically ,  they could see stars going straight up in the east and straight down in the west .\n so it was easier to discern the order in the sky than farther north or farther south ,  where everything would seem more chaotic .\n take the case of the gilbert islands ,  they are part of polynesia ,  and lie very close to the equator .\n and the people there were able to divide the sky into symmetrical boxes ,  according to the main directions ,  north ,  east ,  south and west .\n and they could precisely describe the location of a star by indicating its position in one of those imaginary boxes .\n and they realized that you had to know the stars in order to navigate .\n in fact there was only one word for both in the gilbert islands ,  when you wanted the star expert ,  you ask for a navigator .\n um ,  islanders from all over the pacific learned to use the stars for navigation ,  and they passed this knowledge down from generation to generation .\n some of them utilized stone structures called stone canoes ,  uh ,  and these canoes were on land ,  of course ,  and you can still see them on some islands today .\n they were positioned as if they were heading in the direction of the points on the sea horizon where certain stars would appear and disappear during the night ,  and ,  um ,  young ,  would be navigators sat by the stones at night and turned in different directions to memorize the constellations they saw ,  so they could recognize them and navigate  by them later on when they went out to sea .\n one important way the polynesians had for orienting themselves was by using zenith stars .\n a zenith star was a really bright star that would pass directly overhead at a particular latitude at a particular distance from the equator ,  often at a latitude associated with some particular pacific island .\n so the polynesians could estimate their latitude just by looking straight up ,  by observing whether a certain zenith star passed directly overhead at night ,  they'd know if they have reached the same latitude as a particular island they were trying to get to .\n um ,  another technique used by the polynesians was to look for a star pair ,  that's two stars that rise at the same time ,  or set at the same time ,  and navigators could use these pairs of stars as reference points ,  because they rise or set together only at specific latitudes .\n so navigators might see one star pair setting together .\n and ,  uh would know how far north or south of the equator they were .\n and if they kept on going ,  and the next night they saw the pair of stars setting separately ,  then they would know that they were at a different degree of latitude .\n so looking at rising and setting star pairs is a good technique .\n um  actually it makes more sense with setting stars  they can be watched instead of trying to guess when they'll rise .\n uh ,  ok ,  i think all this shows that navigating doesn't really require fancy navigational instruments  the peoples of pacific islands had such expert knowledge of astronomy as well as navigation that they were able to navigate over vast stretches of open ocean .\n uh ,  it's even possible that polynesian navigators had already sailed to the americas ,  centuries before columbus .", "context_len": 823, "questions": ["Question: what did the technique using zenith stars have in common with the technique using star pairs?

{"context": " up until now in our discussions and readings about the baroque and early classical periods , we've been talking about the development of musical styles and genres within therelatively narrow social context of its patronage by the upper classes .\n composers ,  after all ,  had to earn a living and those who were employed in the services of a specific patron ,  well ,  i don't have to spell it out for you ,  the likes and dislikes of that patron ,  this would've had an effect on what was being composed and performed .\n now ,  of course ,  there were many other influences on composers ,  um ,  such as the technical advances we've seen and the development of some of the instruments ,  uh ,  you remember the transverse flute ,  the clarinet and so on .\n but i think if i were asked to identify a single crucial development in european music of this time ,  it would be the invention of the piano ,  which ,  interestingly enough also had a significant effect on european society of that time .\n and i'll get to that in a minute .\n now ,  as we know ,  keyboard instruments existed long before the piano   the organ ,  which dates back to the middle ages ,  as do other keyboard instruments ,  such as the harpsichord which is still popular today with some musicians .\n but none of these has had as profound an impact as the piano .\n uh ,  the piano was invented in italy in 17 9 .\n the word piano is short for pianoforte ,  a combination of the italian words for soft and loud .\n now ,  unlike the harpsichord which came before it ,  the piano is a percussion instrument .\n you see ,  the harpsichord is actually classified as a string instrument ,  since pressing a key of a harpsichord causes a tiny quill that's connected to the key to pluck the strings that are inside the instrument ,  much the same as a guitar pick plucks the strings of a guitar but pressing the keys of a piano causes tiny felt covered hammers to strike the strings inside the instrument ,  like drumsticks striking the head of a drum .\n this striking action is why the piano is a percussion instrument instead of a string instrument .\n okay ,  so why is this so important ?\n well ,  the percussive effect of those little hammers means that the pianist ,  unlike the harpsichordist ,  can control the dynamics of the sound   how softly or loudly each note is struck ,  hence the name ,  pianoforte ,  soft and loud .\n now ,  artistically for both composers and performers this was a major turning point .\n this brand new instrument ,  capable of producing loud and soft tones ,  greatly expanded the possibilities for conveying emotion .\n this capacity for increased expressiveness ,  in fact ,  was essential to the romantic style that dominated 19th century music .\n but i'm getting ahead of myself .\n um ,  before we get back to the musical impact of this development ,  i wanna take a look at the social impact that i mentioned earlier .\n now ,  in the late 17 's and the earlier 1 8 's ,  the development of the piano coincided with the growth of the middle class in western europe .\n of course folk music ,  traditional songs and dances had always been part of everyday life .\n but as mass production techniques were refined in the 19th century ,  the price of pianos dropped to the point that a larger proportion of the population could afford to own them .\n as pianos became more available ,  they brought classical music ,  the music which previously had been composed only for the upper classes ,  into the lives of the middle class people as well .\n one way in particular that we can see the social impact of this instrument is its role in the lives of women of the time .\n previously ,  it was quite rare for a woman to perform on anything ,  but maybe a harp or maybe she sang .\n but suddenly in the 19th century it became quite acceptable ,  even ,  to some extent ,  almost expected for a middle class european woman to be able to play the piano ,  partly because among upper middle class women it was a sign of refinement .\n but it was also an excellent way for some women to earn money by giving piano lessons .\n and some women ,  those few who had exceptional talent and the opportunity to develop it ,  their lives were dramatically affected .\n later we'll be listening to works by a composer named robert schumann .\n but let's now talk about his wife clara schumann .\n clara schumann was born in germany in 1819 .\n she grew up surrounded by pianos .\n her father sold pianos and both her parents were respected piano teachers .\n she learned to play the instrument when she was a small child and gave her first public recital at age 9 .\n clara grew up to become a well known and respected piano virtuoso ,  a performer of extraordinary skill who not only gave concerts across europe ,  but also was one of the first important female composers for the instrument .", "context_len": 920, "questions": ["Question: what is the lecture mainly about?

{"context": " ok .\n let's continue our discussion about animal behavior by talking about decisions that animals face ,  complex ones .\n animals ,  even insects ,  carry out what look like very complex decision making processes .\n the question is how .\n i mean no one really thinks that ,  say a bee goes through weighing the pros and cons of pollinating this flower or that flower .\n but then how do animals solve complex questions ,  questions that seem to require decision making .\n the answer we'll propose of course is that their behavior is largely a matter of natural selection .\n as an example ,  let's look at foraging behavior among beavers .\n beavers eat plants ,  mostly trees .\n and they also use trees and tree branches to construct their homes in streams and lakes .\n so when they do forage for food and for shelter materials ,  they have to leave their homes and go up on land where their main predators are .\n so there are a number of choices that have to be made about foraging .\n so for example ,  um   they need to decide what kind of tree they should cut down .\n some trees have higher nutritional value than others ,  and some are better for building material ,  and some are good for both   um  aspen trees .\n beavers peel off the bark to eat and they also use the branches for building their shelters .\n so aspens do double duty .\n but ash trees ,  beavers use ash trees only for construction .\n another decision is when to forage for food .\n should they go out during the daytime when it's hotter outside and they have to expend more energy ,  or at night when the weather is cooler but predators are more active ?\n ok ,  but there are two more important issues ,  really the most central ,  the most important ,  ok ?\n first ,  let's say a beaver could get the same amount of wood from a single large tree ,  one that has lots of branches ,  as it could get from three small trees .\n which should it choose ?\n if it chooses one large tree ,  it'll have to carry that large piece of wood back home ,  and lugging a big piece of wood 4  or 5  yards is hard work ,  takes a lot of energy .\n of course it'll have to make only one trip to get the wood back to the water .\n on the other hand ,  if it goes for three small trees instead ,  it will take less energy per tree to get the wood back home ,  but it'll have to make three trips back and forth for the three trees .\n and presumably ,  the more often it wanders from home ,  the more it's likely to be exposed to predators .\n so which is better ,  a single large tree or three small trees ?\n another critical issue and it's related to the first ,  to the size issue ,  is how far from the water should it go to get trees .\n should it be willing to travel a greater distance for a large tree ,  since it'll get so much wood from it ?\n beavers certainly go farther from the water to get an aspen tree than for an ash tree .\n that reflects their relative values .\n but what about size ?\n will it travel farther for a larger tree than it will for a smaller tree ?\n now i would have thought the bigger thetree ,  the farther the beaver would be willing to travel for it .\n that would make sense ,  right ?\n if you're going to travel far ,  make the trip worth it buy bringing back most wood possible .\n but actually ,  the opposite is true .\n beavers will cut down only large trees that are close to the water .\n they will travel far only to cut down certain small trees that they can cut down quickly and drag back home quickly .\n generally ,  the farther they go from the water ,  the smaller the tree they will cut down .\n they're willing to make more trips to haul back less wood ,  which carries a greater risk of being exposed to predators .\n so it looks as though beavers are less interested in minimizing their exposure to predators and more interested in saving energy when foraging for wood ,  which may also explain why beavers forage primarily during the evenings .\n ok ,  so why does their behavior indicate more of a concern with how much energy they expend than with being exposed to predators ?\n no one believes a beaver consciously weighs the pros and cons of each of these elements .\n the answer that some give is that their behavior has evolved over time .\n it's been shaped by constraints over vast stretches of time ,  all of which comes down to the fact that the best foraging strategy for beavers isn't the one that yields the most food or wood .\n it's the one that results in the most descendants ,  the most offspring .\n so let's discuss how this idea works .", "context_len": 902, "questions": ["Question: according to the professor , why do beavers generally forage at night?

{"context": " ok ,  now um ,  a sort of paradigmatic art form of the middle ages was stained glass art .\n stained glass of course is simply glass that has been colored and cut into pieces and re assembled to form a picture or a decorative design .\n to truly experience the beauty of this decorative glass you should see it with light passing through it ,  especially sunlight ,  which is why stained glass is usually used for windows .\n but of course it has other uses ,  especially nowadays .\n um ,  anyway the art of making stained glass windows developed in europe ,  urn ,  during the middle ages and was closely related to church building .\n in the early 11 's a church building method was developed that reduced the stress on the walls so more space could be used for window openings allowing for large and quite elaborate window designs .\n back then ,  the artists made their own glass ,  but first they came up with the design .\n paper was scarce and expensive ,  so typically they drew the design onto a white tabletop .\n they'd draw the principal outline but also outline the shape of each piece of glass to be used and indicate its color .\n now in the window itself the pieces of glass would be held together by strips of lead .\n so in the drawing the artists would also indicate the location of the lead strips .\n then you could put a big piece of glass on the tabletop and see the design right through it and use it to guide the cutting of the glass into smaller pieces .\n and the lead that was just to hold the pieces of glass together ?\n well ,  lead is strong and flexible so it's ideal for joining pieces of glasses cut in different shapes and sizes .\n but up to the 15th century the lead strips also helped create the design .\n they were worked into the window as part of the composition .\n they were used to outline figures to show boundaries just like you might use solid lines in a pencil drawing .\n how did they get the color  ?\n i mean how did they color the glass ?\n well up until the 16th century stained glass was colored during the glass making process itself .\n you got specific colors by adding metallic compounds to the other glass making ingredients .\n so if you wanted red you added copper ,  if you wanted green you added iron .\n you just added these compounds to the other ingredients that the glass was made of .\n so each piece of glass is just one color ?\n yes ,  at least up until the 16th century .\n then they started   um    .\n you started to get painted glass .\n painted glass windows are still referred to as stained glass but the colors were actually painted directly onto clear glass after the glass was made .\n so um    with this kind of stained glass ,  you could paint a piece of glass with more than one color .\n and with painted glass they still used the lead strips ?\n yes ,  with really large windows it took more than one piece of glass ,  so you still needed lead strips to hold the pieces together .\n but the painters actually tried to hide them .\n so it was different from before when the lead strips were part of the design .\n and it is different ,  because with painted glass the idea of light corning through to create the magical effect wasn't the focus any more .\n the paintwork was .\n and painted glass windows became very popular .\n in the 19th century ,  people started using them in private houses and public buildings .\n unfortunately ,  many of the original stained glass windows were thought to be old fashioned and they were actually destroyed ,  replaced by painted glass .\n they actually broke them ?\n that showed good judgment ,  real foresight ,  didn't it ?\n yes ,  if only they had known .\n uh ,  and it's not just that old stained glass is really valuable today ,  we lost possibly great artwork .\n but luckily there was a revival of the early techniques in the mid i 8 's and artists went back to creating colored glass and using the lead strips in their designs .\n the effects are much more beautiful .\n in the 19th century ,  louis tiffany came up with methods to create beautiful effects without having to paint the glass .\n he layered pieces of glass and used thin copper strips instead of lead ,  which let him make these really intricate flowery designs for stained glass ,  which he used in lampshades .\n you've heard of tiffany lampshades ,  right ?\n these of course took advantage of the new innovation of electric lighting .\n electric light bulbs don't give quite the same effect as sunlight streaming through stained glass ,  but it's close .\n so layered glass ,  tiffany glass ,  became very popular and still is today .\n so let's look at some examples of different types of stained glass from each era .", "context_len": 890, "questions": ["Question: what is the lecture mainly about?

{"context": " ok ,  so we have been talking about theories that deal with the effects of human activity on the climate .\n but today i'd like to talk a little bit about other theories that can explain variations in climate .\n and one of the best known is called the milankovitch hypothesis .\n now what the milankovitch hypothesis is about ?\n it says that variations in earth's movements ,  specifically in its orbit around the sun ,  these variations lead to differences in the amount of solar energy that reaches the earth .\n and it is these differences in the amount of energy that's reaching earth from the sun ,  it is what causes variations in earth's climate .\n ok ,  a lot of people think of earth's orbit around the sun as being perfectly circular ,  as smooth and as regular as ,  say ,  the way that hands move on a well  made watch ,  but it just doesn't work that way .\n you are probably aware that the earth's orbit around the sun ,  it is not shaped like a perfect circle .\n it is more of an oval ,  it is elliptical .\n but the shape of this orbit isn't consistent ,  it varies over time ,  over a period of about a thousand years .\n sometimes it is a little more circular ,  sometimes it is more elliptical .\n and when earth's orbit is more elliptical ,  earth is actually closer to the sun during part of the year .\n which makes earth ,  and in particular ,  the northern hemisphere ,  warmer .\n and why is that important ?\n well ,  because most of the planet's glaciers are in the northern hemisphere ,  and if it gets too warm ,  then glaciers will stop forming .\n and we've already talked about how that affects earth's overall temperature .\n the second movement involved in the hypothesis has to do with axial tilt .\n the tilt of earth's axis ,  that imaginery pole that runs through the center of the earth .\n and depending on the angle it tilts at ,  the seasons can be more or less severe .\n it makes winters cooler and summers warmer ,  or what some might say it is doing now ,  it makes summers less hot ,  and more importantly ,  the winters less cold .\n which just like what i mentioned before ,  can also stop ,  prevent glaciers from forming ,  or cause them to melt .\n there is a third movement the hypothesis covers called precession .\n precession ,  basically is the change in the direction of earth's axis of rotation .\n it will take me a million years to explain even just the basics of this movement as precession is quite complex .\n and all these details are way beyond our scope .\n what's important for you to understand is that these three movements ,  well ,  they are cyclical ,  and they work together to form ,  to produce complex but regular variations in earth's climate ,  and lead to the growth or decline of glaciers .\n now ,  when milankovitch first proposed this theory in the 192's ,  many of his colleagues were skeptical .\n milankovitch didn't have any proof .\n actually there wouldn't be any evidence to support his hypothesis until the 197's ,  when oceanographers were able to drill deep into the seafloor and collect samples ,  samples which were then analyzed by geologists .\n and from these samples they were able to put together a history of ocean temperatures going back hundreds of thousands of years ,  and this showed that earth's climate had changed pretty much the way milankovitch's hypothesis suggested it would .\n so this evidence was pretty strong support for the milankovitch hypothesis .\n and by the 198's ,  most people accepted this theory .\n however ,  in the late 198's ,  some scientists were exploring devil 's hole ,  which is basically an extensive water filled cave ,  far from the ocean ,  in nevada2western united states .\n over millions of years ,  groundwater left deposits of a mineral  ,  on the rock within devil's hole .\n and by studying these clacite deposits ,  we can determine the climate conditions ,  the temperatures over the last half million years .\n well ,  the devil 's hole findings contradicted the ones obtained during the 197's ,  so basically the question was ,  were the ages of one or both the samples were wrong ,  or were scientists misunderstanding the significance of the evidence .\n well ,  in the 199's ,  a new study was done on the two samples .\n and the ocean floor samples were found to be correct ,  as were the samples from devil's hole .\n and now it is generally believed that the sample from devil's hole correspond to variations in local climate ,  in the western united states ,  rather than global climate changes .", "context_len": 861, "questions": ["Question: what is the lecture mainly about?

{"context": " ok ,  so one of the challenges that faced ancient civilizations like egypt was timekeeping ,  calendars .\n when you have to grow food for whole cities of people ,  it is important to plant your crops at the right time .\n and when you start having financial obligations ,  rents ,  taxes ,  you have to keep track of how often you pay .\n so today we will look at how the egyptians adressed these problems .\n in fact ,  they ended up using two calendars ,  one to keep track of the natural world ,  or their agriculture concerns ,  and another one ,  that was used to keep track of the business functions of the kingdom .\n so let's take a look at the hows and whys of one ancient egyptian calendar system ,  starting with the nile river .\n why the nile ?\n well ,  there's no other way to put it .\n egyptian life basically revolved around the mysterious rise and fall of the river .\n the success of their agriculture system depended upon them knowing when the river would change .\n so ,  naturally ,  their first calendar was divided up into three seasons ,  each based on the river 's changes  inundation ,  subsidence and harvest .\n the first season was the flooding ,  or inundation ,  when the nile valley was essentially submerged in water for a few months or so .\n and afterwards during the season of subsidence ,  the water would subside ,  or recede ,  revealing a new layer of fertile black silt and allowing for the planting of various crops .\n and finally the time of the year would arrive when the valley would produce crops ,  such as wheat ,  barley ,  fruit ,  all ready to harvest .\n ok ,  so it was important to the ancient egyptians to know when their nile based seasons would occur ,  their way of life depended upon it .\n now ,  the way they used to count time was based on the phases of the moon ,  which ,  regularly and predictably ,  goes through a cycle ,  starting with a new moon ,  then to a full moon ,  and back again to the new moon .\n now this cycle wes then used to determine the length of their month .\n so ,  um ,  one lunar cycle was one egyptian month ,  and about four of the months would constitute a season .\n now ,  12 of these months was an approximately 354 day year .\n so they had a 354 day agricultural calendar that was designed to help them determine when the nile would inunadate the land .\n well ,  of course it had to be more complicated than that .\n the average amount of time between floodings wasn't actually 354 days .\n i mean ,  although it varies ,  the average was clearly longer than 354 days .\n so how did they keep this short calendar in step with the actual flooding of the nile ?\n well ,  their astronomers had discovered that at a certain time of year the brightest star ,  sirius ,  would disappear .\n actually ,  it'd be hidden in the glare of the sun .\n and then ,  a couple of months later ,  one morning in the eartern sky just before dawn ,  sirius would reappear .\n and it happened regularly ,  about every 365 days .\n even more significantly ,  the reappearance of sirius would occur around the same time as the nile's flooding .\n and this annual event is called a heliacal rising4the heliacal rising was a fair indicator of when the nile would flood .\n the next new moon ,  after the heliacal rising of sirius ,  which happened in the last month of the calendar year ,  marked the new year .\n and because the ancient egyptians were using the lunar cycle in combination with this heliacal rising ,  some years ended up having 12 lunar months ,  while others had 13 lunar calender months ,  if sirius didn't rise in the 12th month .\n even though the length of the agricultural calendar still fluctuated ,  with some years having 12 months and others having 13 ,  it ended up being much more reliable than it was before .\n they continually adjusted it to the heliacal rising of sirius ,  ensuring that they never got too far off in their seasons .\n this new calendar was ideal ,  because ,  well ,  it worked well for agricultural purposes as well as for knowing when to have traditional religious festivals .\n so ,  that was their first calendar .\n but was it any way to run a government ?\n they didn't think so .\n for administrative purposes ,  it was very inconvenient to have years of different lengths .\n so another calendar was introduced ,  an administrative one .\n probably soon after 3 ,     bc ,  they declared a 365 day year ,  with 12 months per year ,  with exactly 3  days each month ,  with an extra 5 days at the end of each year .\n this administrative calendar existed alongside the earlier agricultural and religious calendar that depended on the heliacal rising of sirius .\n this administrative calendar was much easier to use for things like scheduling taxes and other things that had to be paid on time .\n over time ,  the calendar got out of step with seasons and the flooding of the nile ,  but for bureaucratic purposes ,  they didn't mind .", "context_len": 941, "questions": ["Question: what are two points the professor makes about the administrative calendar?

{"context": " all right ,  so far we have been looking at some of the core areas of linguistics ,  like syntax ,  phonology ,  semantics ,  and these are things that we can study by looking at one language at a time ,  how sounds ,  and words ,  and sentences work in a given language .\n but the branch of historical linguistics ,  involves the comparison of several different languages ,  or the comparison of different stages of a single language .\n now ,  if you are comparing different languages ,  and you notice that they have a lot in common .\n maybe they have similar sounds and words that correspond to one another that have the same meaning and that sound similar .\n let's use a real world example .\n in the 18th century ,  scholars who have studied the ancient languages ,  sanskrit ,  latin and greek ,  noticed that these three languages had many similarities .\n and there might be several reasons why languages such as these had so much in common .\n maybe it happened by chance ,  maybe one language was heavily influenced by borrowed words from the other .\n or maybe ,  maybe the languages developed from the same source language long ago ,  that is ,  maybe they are genetically related ,  that was what happened with sanskrit ,  latin and greek .\n these languages had so many similarities that it was concluded that they must have all come from the same source .\n and talk about important discoveries in linguistics ,  this was certainly one of them .\n the scholars referred to that source language as proto indo european ,  proto indo european is a reconstructed language .\n meaning ,  it is what linguists concluded a parent language of sanskrit ,  latin and greek would have to be like .\n and proto indo european branched out into other languages ,  which evolved into others ,  so in the end ,  many languages spoken all over the world today can trace their ancestry back to one language ,  proto indo european ,  which was spoken several thousand years ago .\n now ,  one way of representing the evolution of languages ,  showing the way languages are related to each other ,  is with the family tree model .\n like a family tree that you might use to trace back through generations of ancestors ,  only it's showing a family of geneticall related languages instead of people .\n a tree model for a language family starts with one language ,  which we call a mother language ,  for example ,  proto indo european .\n the mother language ,  is the line on the top of this diagram ,  over time ,  it branches off into new daughter languages ,  which branch into daughter languages of their own ,  and languages that have the same source ,  the same mother ,  are called sisters ,  they share a lot of characteristics ,  and this went on until we are looking at a big upside down tree languages like this .\n it is incomplete of course ,  just to give you an idea .\n so that's the family tree model ,  basically .\n now ,  the tree model is a convenient way of representing the development of a language family and of showing how closely related two of more languages are .\n but it is obviously very simplified ,  having a whole language represented by just one branch on a tree doesn't really do justice to all the variations within that language .\n you know ,  spanish that spoken in spain isn't exactly the same as spanish that is spoken in mexico ,  for example .\n another issue is that languages evolve very gradually ,  but the tree model makes it look like they evolve over night , like there was a distinct moment in time when a mother language clearly broke off into daughter languages .\n but it seems to me it probably wasn't quite like that .", "context_len": 679, "questions": ["Question: why does the professor mention variation within a language?

{"context": " ok ,  today we are going to continue our discussion of plant life in coastal salt marshes of north america .\n salt marshes are among the least inviting environments for plants .\n the water is salty ,  there is little shade and the ocean tide comes in and out ,  constantly flooding the marsh ,  so the variety of plants found in salt marshes is limited ,  but there is a plant genus that thrives there ,  the spartina .\n in fact ,  the spartina genus is the dominant plant found in salt marshes .\n you can find one type of the spartina ,  saltmarsh cordgrass ,  growing in low marsh areas .\n in higher marsh areas ,  you are likely to find a spartina commonly called salt meadow hay .\n so how is the spartina able to survive in an envrionment that would kill most plants ?\n well ,  it is because salt marsh grasses have found ways to adapt to the conditions there .\n first of all ,  they are able to withstand highly saline conditions .\n one really interesting adaptation is the ability to reverse the process of osmosis6 .\n typically ,  the process of osmosis works   well ,  when water moves through the wall of a plant cell ,  it will move from the side containing water with the lowest amount of salt into the side containing the highest amount of salt .\n so imagine what would happen if a typical plant suddenly found itself in salt water ,  the water contained in the plant cells ,  that is water with very little salt would be drawn out toward the seawater ,  water with a lot of salt .\n so you can see the fresh water contained in the plant will be removed and the plant will quickly lose all its water and dehydrate .\n but what about the spartinas ,  well ,  they allow a certain amount of salt to enter their cells ,  bringing the salt content of the water within the plant ,  to a slightly higher concentration than that of the surrounding seawater .\n so instead of fresh water moving out of the plant cells ,  salt from the seawater enters ,  reverse osmosis ,  and this actually strengthens the cells .\n another adaptation to the salty environment is the ability to excrete excess salt back to the environment .\n that's why you might see a spartina shimmering in the sunlight .\n what's reflecting the light is not salt from seawater that has evaporated ,  although that's a good guess .\n but it is actually the salt that came from within the plant .\n pretty cool ,  eh ?\n you can really impress your friends and family with that little  ?\n the next time you are in a salt marsh .\n but coping with salt is not the only challenge for plants in the salt marsh .\n soil there is dense and very low in oxygen ,  so spartinas have air tubes ,  air enters through tiny openings on the leaves ,  the tubes provide direct pipe line for oxygen ,  carrying it down the leaves through the stems and into the roots ,  where it is needed .\n if you pull up a spartina ,  you might even notice some reddish mud on some of the roots ,  this is caused by oxygen reacting with iron sulfide in the soil ,  and it produces iron oxide or rust .\n now ,  although the spartinas have adapted several chemical and physical mechanisms that allow them to thrive in salt water and to feed oxygen to their roots .\n there is yet another aspect of the harsh environment that they have to adapt to ,  the force of tides and occasional violent storms .\n wind and water are constantly crashing into these plants .\n so as you might have guessed ,  they have developed a means of solidly anchoring themselves into the soil .\n how ?\n they have tough sort of underground stems called rhizome ,  rhizomes from one plant grow through the muddy soil and interlock with those of other nearby plants ,  the plants form a kind of colony ,  a community that will thrive and perish together .\n because alone as single plants ,  they cannot survive .\n \\of course the plants in these colonies also need tough resilient stems above the soil ,  stems that can bent a lot but not break as water constantly crashes into them .\n so in addtion to the interlocking underground rhizomes ,  they have yet another adaptation ,  and it is    well ,  we are back to reverse osmosis again ,  by adjusting the osmotic pressure so that the cells are always fully inflated ,  the plant is able to withstand great pressure befor snapping ,  so spartinas may look like simple marsh grass ,  but they are really a wonder of chemistry ,  physics and structural engineering that allows them to survive and even thrive in an evironment in which most plants will wilt7 and die within hours .\n life in new hampshire salt marshes  .", "context_len": 858, "questions": ["Question: what is the lecture mainly about?

{"context": " now ,  many people consider john watson to be the founder of behaviorism .\n and like other behaviorists ,  he believed that psychologists should study only the behaviors they can observe and measure .\n they're not interested in mental processes .\n while a person could describe his thoughts ,  no one else can see or hear them to verify the accuracy of his report .\n but one thing you can observe is muscular habits .\n what watson did was to observe muscular habits because he viewed them as a manifestation of thinking .\n one kind of habits that he studied are laryngeal habits .\n watson thought laryngeal habits  .\n you know ,  from larynx ,  in other words ,  related to the voice box  .\n he thought those habits were an expression of thinking .\n he argued that for very young children ,  thinking is really talking out loud to oneself because they talk out loud even if they're not trying to communicate with someone in particular .\n as the individual matures ,  that overt talking to oneself becomes covert talking to oneself ,  but thinking still shows up as a laryngeal habit .\n one of the bits of evidence that supports this is that when people are trying to solve a problem ,  they ,  um ,  typically have increased muscular activity in the throat region .\n that is ,  if you put electrodes on the throat and measure muscle potential muscle activity you discover that when people are thinking ,  like if they're diligently trying to solve a problem ,  that there is muscular activity in the throat region .\n so ,  watson made the argument that problem solving ,  or thinking ,  can be defined as a set of behaviors a set of responses and in this case the response he observed was the throat activity .\n that's what he means when he calls it a laryngeal habit .\n now ,  as i am thinking about what i am going to be saying ,  my muscles in my throat are responding .\n so ,  thinking can be measured as muscle activity .\n now ,  the motor theory  .\n yes ?\n professor blake ,  um ,  did he happen to look at people who sign ?\n i mean deaf people ?\n uh ,  he did indeed ,  um ,  and to jump ahead ,  what one finds in deaf individuals who use sign language when they're given problems of various kinds ,  they have muscular changes in their hands when they are trying to solve a problem  .\n muscle changes in the hand ,  just like the muscular changes going on in the throat region for speaking individuals .\n so ,  for watson ,  thinking is identical with the activity of muscles .\n a related concept of thinking was developed by william james .\n it's called ideomotor action .\n ideomotor action is an activity that occurs without our noticing it ,  without our being aware of it .\n i'll give you one simple example .\n if you think of locations ,  there tends to be eye movement that occurs with your thinking about that location .\n in particular ,  from where we're sitting ,  imagine that you're asked to think of our university library .\n well ,  if you close your eyes and think of the library ,  and if you're sitting directly facing me ,  then according to this notion ,  your eyeballs will move slightly to the left ,  to your left ,   cause the library's in that general direction .\n james and others said that this is an idea leading to a motor action ,  and that's why it's called  ideomotor action  an idea leads to motor activity .\n if you wish to impress your friends and relatives ,  you can change this simple process into a magic trick .\n ask people to do something such as i've just described  think of something on their left  think of something on their right .\n you get them to think about two things on either side with their eyes closed ,  and you watch their eyes very carefully .\n and if you do that ,  you'll discover that you can see rather clearly the eye movement that is ,  you can see the movement of the eyeballs .\n now ,  then you say ,  think of either one and i'll tell which you're thinking of .\n ok .\n well ,  watson makes the assumption that muscular activity is equivalent to thinking .\n but given everything we've been talking about here ,  one has to ask  are there alternatives to this motor theory this claim that muscular activities are equivalent to thinking ?\n is there anything else that might account for this change in muscular activity ,  other than saying that it is thinking ?\n and the answer is clearly yes .\n is there any way to answer the question definitively ?\n i think the answer is no .", "context_len": 849, "questions": ["Question: the professor describes a magic trick to the class , what does the magic trick demonstrate?

{"context": " hi ,  everyone .\n good to see you all today .\n actually ,  i expected the population to be a lot lower today .\n it typically runs between 5  and 6  percent on the day the research paper is due .\n um ,  i was hoping to have your exams back today ,  but ,  uh ,  the situation was that i went away for the weekend ,  and i was supposed to get in yesterday at five ,  and i expected to fully complete all the exams by midnight or so ,  which is the time that i usually go to bed ,  but my flight was delayed ,  and i ended up not getting in until one o clock in the morning .\n anyway ,  i'll do my best to have them finished by the next time we meet .\n ok .\n in the last class ,  we started talking about useful plant fibers .\n in particular ,  we talked about cotton fibers ,  which we said were very useful ,  not only in the textile industry ,  but also in the chemical industry ,  and in the production of many products ,  such as plastics ,  paper ,  explosives ,  and so on .\n today we'll continue talking about useful fibers ,  and we'll begin with a fiber that's commonly known as  manila hemp .\n now ,  for some strange reason ,  many people believe that manila hemp is a hemp plant .\n but manila hemp is not really hemp .\n it's actually a member of the banana family  it even bears little banana shaped fruits .\n the  manila  part of the name makes sense ,  because manila hemp is produced chiefly in the philippine islands and ,  of course ,  the capital city of the philippines is manila .\n now ,  as fibers go ,  manila hemp fibers are very long .\n they can easily be several feet in length and they're also very strong ,  very flexible .\n they have one more characteristic that's very important ,  and that is that they are exceptionally resistant to salt water .\n and this combination of characteristics long ,  strong ,  flexible ,  resistant to salt water makes manila hemp a great material for ropes ,  especially for ropes that are gonna be used on ocean going ships .\n in fact ,  by the early 194 's ,  even though steel cables were available ,  most ships in the united states navy were not moored with steel cables  they were moored with manila hemp ropes .\n now ,  why was that ?\n well ,  the main reason was that steel cables degrade very ,  very quickly in contact with salt water .\n if you've ever been to san francisco ,  you know that the golden gate bridge is red .\n and it's red because of the zinc paint that goes on those stainless steel cables .\n that ,  if they start at one end of the bridge and they work to the other end ,  by the time they finish ,  it's already time to go back and start painting the beginning of the bridge again ,  because the bridge was built with steel cables ,  and steel cables can't take the salt air unless they're treated repeatedly with a zinc based paint .\n on the other hand ,  plant products like manila hemp ,  you can drag through the ocean for weeks on end .\n if you wanna tie your anchor to it and drop it right into the ocean ,  that's no problem ,  because plant fibers can stand up for months ,  even years ,  in direct contact with salt water .\n ok .\n so how do you take plant fibers that individually you could break with your hands and turn them into a rope that's strong enough to moor a ship that weighs thousands of tons ?\n well ,  what you do is you extract these long fibers from the manila hemp plant ,  and then you take several of these fibers ,  and you group them into a bundle ,  because by grouping the fibers you greatly increase their breaking strength that bundle of fibers is much stronger than any of the individual fibers that compose it .\n and then you take that bundle of fibers and you twist it a little bit ,  because by twisting it ,  you increase its breaking strength even more .\n and then you take several of these little bundles ,  and you group and twist them into bigger bundles ,  which you then group and twist into even bigger bundles ,  and so on ,  until eventually ,  you end up with a very ,  very strong rope .", "context_len": 809, "questions": ["Question: what aspect of manila hemp fibers does the professor mainly discuss in the lecture?

{"context": " ok ,  we have been talking about how throughout history ,  it was often difficult for people to give up ideas which have long been taken for granted as scientific truth ,  even if those ideas were false .\n in astronomy ,  for example ,  the distinction between the solar system and the universe wasn't clear until modern times .\n the ancient greeks believed that what we called the solar system was in fact the entire universe ,  and that the universe was geocentric .\n geocentric means earth centered ,  so the geocentric view holds that the sun ,  the planets ,  and the stars ,  all revolve around the earth ,  which is stationary .\n of course ,  we now know that the planets ,  including earth ,  revolve around the sun ,  and that the solar system is only a tiny part of the universe .\n so ,  why did the ancient greeks believe that the earth was the center of the universe ?\n well ,  it made sense to them .\n observations of the sky make it appear as if the sun ,  the moon ,  and the stars all revolve around the earth everyday ,  while the earth itself stayed in one place .\n and this view is also supported by their philosophical and religious beliefs about the origin and structure of the universe .\n it was presented in the works of well known greek philosophers as early as the fourth century b .\n c .\n e .\n ,  and the geocentric theory continue to prevail in western thought for almost 2 ,     years ,  until the 17th century .\n now ,  what's especially interesting is that when astronomical observations were made that seemed to be inconsistent with the geocentric view ,  the ancient greeks did not really consider alternative theories .\n it was so intuitive ,  so sensible that the earth was the center of the universe that astronomers found ways to explain those seemingly inconsistent phenomena within the geocentric view .\n for example ,  greek astronomers made excellent ,  very accurate observations of the movements of the planets ,  but the observations revealed a bit of a problem .\n the geocentric theory said ,  that the planets would move around the earth in one direction .\n however ,  astronomers noticed that at times ,  several planets seem to stop moving in one direction and start moving backward in their orbits around the earth ,  and they came up with a theory that these planets themselves moved in smaller circles called epicycles as they travelled around the earth .\n here's a picture of what they imagined .\n you see how this epicycle theory could account for the seemingly backward motion of the planet .\n of course ,  today we know that this appearance of backward motion is caused by the fact that earth ,  as well as other planets ,  all move in their own orbits around the sun ,  and the relative movements of the planets with respect to each other can get quite complex .\n however ,  there were a few astronomers in greece and other places who didn't agree with the geocentric view ,  for example ,  a greek astronomer who lived in the third century b .\n c .\n e .\n he proposed the theory that our planetary system might be heliocentric ,  his name was aristarchus .\n heliocentric means sun centered ,  that the earth revolves around the sun .\n aristarchus recognized from his calculations that the sun was much larger than the earth and other planets .\n it was probably this discovery that led him to conclude that the universe is heliocentric .\n i mean ,  isn't it more sensible to think that a smaller heavenly body would orbit a larger one ,  rather than the opposite ?\n however ,  his proposition was rejected largely based on other scientific beliefs held at the time ,  which all made sense in a way even if they were incorrect .\n let me mention two objections greeks made to aristarchus's theory .\n first ,  they believe that everything that moves creates its own wind ,  so to speak ,  everyone has this experience when you are running ,  right ?\n so ,  they thought that if the earth itself was moving ,  there would have to be a constant wind blowing ,  sweeping them off their feet ,  and of course there wasn't .\n and second ,  the idea of an earth that moved didn't fit in with the ancient greeks  understanding of gravity .\n they thought that gravity was basically a natural tendency of all things to move towards the center of the universe ,  which was the earth ,  or the center of the earth ,  so that explains why apples and other falling objects were falling straight down .\n if the sun was at the center of the universe ,  things would fall toward the sun and away from the earth ,  which of course they didn't .\n so these were some of the reasons they rejected the heliocentric theory .", "context_len": 861, "questions": ["Question: in the professor's view , what might have caused aristarchus to propose the heliocentric theory?

{"context": " probably back in some previous biology course you learned that snakes evolved from lizards ,  and that the first snakes weren't venomous and then along came more advanced snakes ,  the venomous snakes .\n ok ,  venomous snakes are the ones that secrete poisonous substances or venom ,  like the snakes of the viper family or cobras .\n then there is non venomous snakes like constrictors and pythons .\n another family of snakes ,  the colubrids ,  don't really fit neatly into either category though .\n colubrids ,  and you probably learned this too ,  although they are often classified as venomous snakes ,  they are actually generally non venomous .\n they are classified as venomous snakes because they resemble them ,  their advanced features more than the other non venomous snakes .\n now ,  what if i told you that there is a good chance that most everything i just said is wrong ?\n well ,  everything except the part about snakes evolving from lizards .\n see ,  the basic theory about snake evolution has been challenged by a recent study that revealed a whole new understanding of evolutionary relationship for reptiles ,  you know ,  which reptiles descended from which ancestors .\n the researchers study the proteins in the venom genes of various species of colubrids .\n emm   snake venom is a mixture of proteins ,  some toxic ,  poisonous ,  and some not .\n by analyzing the dna ,  the genetic material of the proteins ,  the researchers could focus on the toxic genes and use them to trace the evolution of snake venom ,  and from this ,  the evolution of snakes .\n traditionally ,  to understanding evolutionary relationships ,  we looked at various easily observed physical characteristics of animals ,  their skeleton ,  the size of their brain ,  and   and then classify them based on similarities and differences .\n the problem with this method is that characteristics that appear similar may actually have developed in quite different ways .\n for example ,  some venoms are chemical based ,  and others are bacteria based ,  so they clearly had to have developed along different routes and may not be as closely related as we thought .\n now ,  and not everyone will agree about this .\n the classification based on dna seems to be much more reliable .\n ok ,  back to the research .\n the researchers found that venom evolved before snakes even existed ,  about a hundred million years before .\n now ,  a couple of venomous lizards were included in this study .\n and the researchers found some of the same dna in their venom as in the snakes  venom .\n this suggested that the common ancestor of all snakes was actually venomous lizard ,  which means that actually ,  according to this research ,  anyway ,  in terms of the snakes  ancestry ,  there is no such thing as a non venomous snake ,  not even colubrids .\n what separates colubrids from other snakes we have been classifying is venomous ,  is not the lack of venom ,  but the lack of an effective way to deliver the venom into its prey .\n in most venomous snakes ,  like vipers and cobras ,  the venom is used to catch and inmoblize the prey  but in colubrids ,  venom drips onto the prey only after the prey is in the snake's mouth .\n so for colubrids ,  the venom must serve some other purpose ,  maybe linked to digesting prey .\n as the different families of venomous snakes evolved ,  the teeth moved forward ,  becoming larger ,  and the venom becoming stronger ,  so the evolution of the obvious venomous snakes ,  like cobras and vipers ,  is about the evolution of an efficient delivery system ,  not so much the evolution of the venom itself .\n so ,  if there are no truly non venomous snakes ,  were the so called non venomous snakes ,  like constrictors and pythons ,  were they venomous at some point in their evolution ?\n well ,  that's not clear at this point .\n constrictors have evolved to kill their prey by crushing ,  but perhaps they once were venomous ,  and then at some point their venom producing apparatus4 wasn't needed anymore ,  so it gradually disappeared .\n there's one species of snake ,  the brown tree snake ,  that uses both constriction and venom ,  depending on its prey .\n so ,  well ,  it is possible .\n so ,  we have these new concepts of snakes  evolution and a new dna database ,  all these information on the genetic makeup of snake venom .\n and what we have learned from this has led researchers to believe that venom proteins may have some exciting applications in the field of medical research .\n you see ,  venom alters biological functions in the same way certain drugs do ,  and the big benefit of drugs made from snakes venom would be that they target only certain cells ,  so maybe that'll create fewer side effects .\n now ,  it sounds far fetched5 ,  venom is the basis for human drugs .\n so far ,  only one protein has been targeted for study as a potential drug ,  but who knows ,  maybe someday .", "context_len": 896, "questions": ["Question: why does the professor mention the brown tree snake?

{"context": " now ,  we've been talking about the loss of animal habitat from housing developments ,  um  ,  growing cities   small habitat losses .\n but today i wanna begin talking about what happens when habitat is reduced across a large area .\n there are ,  of course ,  animal species that require large areas of habitat ,  and some migrate over very long distances .\n so what's the impact of habitat loss on those animals   animals that need large areas of habitat ?\n well ,  i'll use the humming birds as an example .\n now you know a humming bird is amazingly small ,  but even though it's really tiny ,  it migrates over very long distances ,  travels up and down the western hemisphere   the americas ,  back and forth between where it breeds in the summer and the warmer climates where it spends the winter .\n so we would say that this whole area over which it migrates is its habitat because on this long distance journey ,  it needs to come down to feed and sleep every so often ,  right ?\n well ,  the humming bird beats its wings   get this   about 3 thousand times per minute .\n so you think ,  wow ,  it must need a lot of energy ,  a lot of food ,  right ?\n well ,  it does .\n it drinks a lot of nectar from flowers and feeds on some insects ,  but it's energy efficient too .\n you can't say it isn't .\n i mean ,  as it flies all the way across the gulf of mexico ,  it uses up almost none of its body fat .\n but that doesn't mean it doesn't need to eat .\n so humming birds have to rely on plants in their natural habitat .\n and it goes without saying ,  but ,  well ,  the opposite is true as well ,  plants depend on humming birds too .\n there are some flowers that can only be pollinated by the humming birds .\n without it stopping to feed and spreading pollen from flower to flower ,  these plants would cease to exist .\n but the problem ,  well ,  as natural habitat along these migration routes is developed by humans for housing or agriculture or cleared for raising cattle ,  for instance ,  there is less food available for migrating humming birds .\n their nesting sites are affected too ,  the same ,  by the same sorts of human activities .\n and all of these activities pose a real threat to the humming bird population .\n so to help them survive ,  we need to preserve their habitats .\n and one of the concrete ways people have been doing this is by cleaning up polluted habitat areas and then replanting flowers ,  um ,  replanting native flowers that humming birds feed on .\n promoting ecological tourism is another way to help save their habitat .\n as the number of visitors ,  eco tourists who come to humming bird habitats to watch the birds ,  the more the number of visitors grows ,  the more local businesses profit ,  so ecological tourism can bring financial rewards ,  all the more reason to value these beautiful little creatures in their habitat ,  right ?\n but to understand more about how to protect and support humming birds the best we can ,  we've got to learn more about their breeding ,  nesting sites and migration routes ,  and also about the natural habitats we find there .\n that should help us determine how to prevent further decline in the population .\n a good research method ,  a good way to learn more ,  is by running a banding study .\n banding the birds allows us to track them over their lifetime .\n it's been a practice that's been used by researchers for years .\n in fact ,  most of what we know about humming birds comes from banding studies ,  where we capture a humming bird and make sure all the information about it ,  like its weight and age and length ,  are all recorded ,  put into international ,  an international information database .\n and then we place an extremely lightweight band on one of its legs ,  well ,  what looks like a leg ,  although technically it's considered part of the bird's foot .\n anyway ,  these bands are perfectly safe ,  and some humming birds have worn them for years with no evidence of any problems .\n the band is labeled with a tracking number ,  oh ,  and there is a phone number on the band for people to call for free ,  to report a banded bird they've found or recaptured .\n so when a banded bird is recaptured and reported ,  we learn about its migration route ,  its growth ,  and how long it has been alive ,  its lifespan .\n one recaptured bird had been banded almost 12 years earlier   she is one of the oldest humming birds on record .\n another interesting thing we've learned is that some humming birds ,  um ,  they no longer use a certain route .\n they travel by a different route to reach their destination .\n and findings like these have been of interest to biologists and environmental scientists in a number of countries who are trying to understand the complexities of how changes in a habitat affect the species in it .", "context_len": 930, "questions": ["Question: what does the professor imply

{"context": " we've been talking about animal cognition the study of animal intelligence .\n now ,  much of the research in this area is motivated by the search for animal analogues ,  or parallels to human cognitive processes .\n and one of the processes we've been investigating is metacognition .\n what is metacognition ?\n well ,  it's being aware of what one knows or feels ,  uh ,  um  having an awareness of one's state of mind .\n and making decisions about behavior based on what one knows .\n researchers have long been interested in whether animals possess this capability ,  but but couldn't test it because animals aren't able to report their feelings .\n but recently one group of researchers found a way to solve this problem .\n they did studies with with monkeys and dolphins that provide evidence that these animals have the ability to feel uncertainty ,  to feel unsure about something and and well ,  to know that they are uncertain .\n so how could these researchers figure out if an animal feels uncertainty .\n well ,  it began with a study one of them did on a dolphin ,  who had been trained to recognize a particular high pitched tone .\n the dolphin was taught to press one of two paddles depending on whether it heard the high tone or one that was lower .\n food was a reward for a correct response .\n but if the wrong paddle was pressed ,  the dolphin had to wait several seconds before it could try again .\n the task varied in difficulty according to the pitch of the second tone .\n the closer it came in pitch to the first one ,  the hard it became for the dolphin to correctly identify it as low .\n and the researcher noted that the dolphin is quite eager to press the paddle when it was sure of the answer ,  but exhibited hesitation during difficult trials .\n next the researcher introduced a third option ,  a third paddle that would initiate a new trial ,  giving the dolphin the choice of passing on difficult trials .\n once the dolphin figured out the result of pressing this new paddle ,  it did choose it frequently when the trial was difficult .\n the researcher took that as an indication that the animal wanted to pass because it didn't know the answer and knew it didn't know .\n but there was a problem .\n other researchers protested that the  the opt out response was simply a learned or conditioned response .\n you remember intro to psychology ,  right ?\n in other words ,  by pressing the pass paddle ,  the dolphin avoided having to wait and hasten the possibility of a full reward by moving directly to the next trial .\n so the experiment didn't necessarily indicate that the dolphin had knowledge of its own uncertainty ,  just that it wanted to avoid negative consequences .\n so more recently ,  our researcher and his colleagues devised a new study ,  this time using monkeys .\n in this experiment ,  the monkeys had to identify certain patterns displayed on a computer screen .\n these patterns were analogous to the tones used in the dolphin study .\n one type of pattern was of a specific density and was to be classified as dense ,  while the second type of pattern could vary in density ,  but was always less dense than the first one .\n and the monkeys  task was to identify this second type as sparse .\n so the denser the second type of pattern was ,  the more difficult the task became .\n and as in a previous study ,  the monkeys were given a third choice that would allow them to pass on to a new trial .\n but unlike in the dolphin experiment ,  the monkeys had to complete four trials before they got any feedback .\n they didn't know if they responded correctly or incorrectly after each trial because there was no reward or punishment .\n at the end of four trials ,  feedback was given .\n the monkeys received a full reward for each correct response .\n and a time out during which a buzzer was sounded for each incorrect response .\n but the monkeys had no way to tell which reward or punishment was associated with which response .\n and they didn't get either reward or punishment for choosing the pass option ,  the um the uncertainty response .\n but nevertheless they still chose this option in the appropriate circumstances when the trial was particularly difficult .\n and this is evidence that it wasn't a conditioned response ,  because that response didn't guarantee a faster reward .\n so what does all this tell us about animal consciousness or animals  awareness of themselves and their state of mind ?\n can we really know what's going on in the minds of animals ?\n no .\n of course not .\n but exploring the metacognitive capacity of animals could become an important criterion in highlighting the similarities and differences between human and animal minds .\n http

{"context": " so last week we started our unit on residential architecture in the united states .\n so today we'll be surveying a number of architects who made contributions to residential architecture in the 19th century .\n now ,  it's worth noting that people who designed homes at that time probably had to deal with a certain amount of discouragement .\n since there were other architects who thought it was more respectable to design the kind of buildings and maybe other structures that were less less utilitarian in their function .\n in fact ,  an article from an 1876 issue of a journal called the american architect and building news stated that ,  and this is a quote ,  they stated that  the planning of houses isn't architecture at all  !\n so keep that journal article in mind as we look at the work of an architect named harriet morrison irwin .\n harriet morrison irwin was from the south ,  born in north carolina in 1828 .\n at the time ,  there weren't many architects from the southern united states .\n and as you might imagine ,  very few of them were women .\n so irwin was really a pretty exceptional case .\n and she wasn't even formally trained as an architect .\n her educational background was in literature .\n the above text is a transcript of this lecture prepared by lady bird  qq519626928  .\n so she just had like unnatural gift for architecture ?\n yes .\n she was actually a writer for several years .\n but she did have a penchant for math and engineering ,  so she read a lot about it on her own .\n um especially the architectural essays written by the british critic   john ruskin .\n and john ruskin believed what ?\n um that buildings should have a lot of access to the outdoors ,  to nature .\n ruskin said that being close to nature was great for people's mental and physical health .\n right !\n so that was an influence .\n now ,  harriet irwin's contribution to architecture was relatively minor but still quite interesting and unique .\n she designed a house with a hexagonal shape .\n josh ?\n a house with six sides ?\n instead of the standard ,  you know ,  four sided home ?\n yeah .\n the rooms inside the house were also hexagonal ,  six sided .\n so one important thing was that the rooms were arranged around a chimney in the center of the house ,  which could provide heat for the whole house through flues ,  uh ,  small air passageways into each room ,  as opposed to having a fireplace in every room ,  which would require more cleaning and make the air inside the house dirtier .\n the house's shape also allowedfor more windows .\n each room had a large wall that could fit a couple of big winters ,  giving every room a nice view of the outdoors .\n plus there would be good airflow through the house .\n yes .\n in warm weather when you can open all the windows .\n good .\n the doors to the house as well uh the house didn't have a main entrance or any hallways .\n so there could be a couple of entry doors in different places ,  which like the windows ,  provided ready access to the outdoors .\n so ,  what other advantages might there be to hexagonal rooms ?\n ok .\n think about cleaning .\n what part of a room is usually the hardest to clean ?\n like to sweep with a broom .\n oh !\n the corners .\n because in square or rectangular rooms ,  the corners are at 9  degree angles .\n it's hard to reach all the dust that gathers in the corners .\n but if irwin's rooms were closer to a circle than a square ,  it would be easier to reach all the dust and dirt with a broom .\n right ?\n now ,  um biographers who wrote about irwin in the 19th century ,  i feel ,  sort of downplayed the ingenuity of her design .\n but i think if she had designed this house today ,  the same biographers would praise her for coming up with a floor plan that emphasized function ,  efficient function of a house ,  as well as a design that's creative and unique .\n in any cases ,  three houses were built in irwin's time that used her hexagonal design .\n and in 1869 ,  when she was 41 ,  irwin became the first woman in the united states to receive a patent for an architectural design .\n and that speaks volumes  if you ask me .", "context_len": 796, "questions": ["Question: what are the speakers mainly discussing?

{"context": " ways in which animals adapt to their environment are often quite ingenious actually .\n and as an example of this ,  let me tell you about a fish ,  a group of fish known as the notothenioids .\n there's over 9  known species of notothenioids and they inhabit both shallow and very deep waters ,  mostly around antarctica .\n many are fairly small ,  though the largest species can weigh up to 15  kilograms .\n notothenioids can be identified by their large eyes ,  which are covered by a thick insulating layer of clear tissue .\n this tissue protects their eyes from freezing .\n remember ,  the freezing point of ocean water ,  salt water ,  is lower than for fresh water ,  negative 1 .\n 9 degree celsius   1 .\n 9 c  .\n so it can get a lot colder for fish in an ocean ,  say ,  than in a river or lake .\n so this means that the ocean waters around antarctica are cold enough to freeze most types of fish ,  but notothenioids don't freeze .\n in fact ,  they thrive .\n they account for some 95  of all fish in the southern ocean ,  the ocean that surrounds antarctica .\n so ,  how unusual is that ?\n to have a single family of fish dominating an entire ocean .\n i mean ,  think of say ,  tropical or temperate marine environments ,  which have incredibly diverse fish populations .\n coral reefs ,  for example ,  support over 4    types of fish ,  along with sponges ,  crustaceans ,  and many other organisms .\n so ,  exactly when and how did the notothenioids come to dominate the southern ocean ?\n well ,  around 3  million years ago ,  the waters around antarctica were a lot warmer than they are today .\n um  at that time ,  antarctica was connected to south america ,  which means that warm air from the north could flow southward and heat up the antarctica waters .\n because the water around antarctica then was relatively warm ,  it supported many types of fish .\n and we know this from fossil evidence .\n but the 9  or so species of notothenioids that exist today didn't exist at all back then .\n in fact ,  only one ancestral notothenioid species existed .\n but somewhere between 5 million and 14 million years ago ,  two major changes took place .\n first ,  what we call a chance mutation .\n a tiny genetic change occurred in that one notothenioid species .\n its dna allowed for the production of a special protein ,  a protein that prevents the fish from freezing .\n the way this this anti freeze protein works is  it binds to any ice crystals that form inside the fish .\n this binding action prevents the ice crystals from growing larger .\n and this is what prevents notothenioids from freezing .\n now ,  at that time ,  the waters the notothenioids inhabited were still not freezing cold ,  so the protein didn't really make a difference as far as the fish's survival .\n but this would change ,  because in the same period of geologic time there was a shift in the earth's continental plates .\n continental drift caused antarctica to move apart from the landmass of south america and to drift into the southern polar region .\n this resulted in a powerful water current encircling antarctica ,  which prevented the antarctic waters from mixing with warmer water .\n so the southern ocean ,  isolated from that warm airflow from the north ,  cooled down drastically ,  to the kinds of sub freezing temperatures we associate with it today .\n now ,  most fish species couldn't survive in this frigid environment and they became extinct .\n but that one notothenioid species ,  with its unique ability to produce that anti freeze protein ,  thrived .\n it had virtually the entire southern ocean to itself !\n so ?\n well ,  there was little or no competition for food or space .\n you might think of it as um as a a kind of ecological vacuum .\n and the notothenioids exploited fully .\n the species migrated into different habitats throughout the southern ocean .\n and its population increased dramatically ,  with various sub populations migrating into different parts of the ocean .\n over time these sub populations in all those different habitats well ,  they developed very different physical traits .\n they adapted to survive in their particular ecological niche ,  their their position within a particular ecosystem .\n we call this type of species diversification within a species adaptive radiation .\n and what adaptive radiation is is  an evolutionary process by which a parent species rapidly undergoes changes resulting in various new species in order to fill multiple ecological niches .\n so in the case of the notothenioids ,  that single species started colonizing empty habitats to such an extent that it evolved into a broad range of new species ,  the 9  or so notothenioid species that we have today .\n so let me switch to adaptive radiation with regard to another species that's also been very successful .", "context_len": 872, "questions":

{"context": " ok ,  the next kind of animal behavior i want to talk about might be familiar to you .\n you may have seen ,  for example ,  a bird that's in the middle of a mating ritual ,  and suddenly it stops and preens ,  you know ,  it takes a few moments to straighten its feathers ,  and then returns to the mating ritual .\n this kind of behavior ,  this doing something that seems completely out of place ,  is what we call a  displacement activity  .\n displacement activities are activities that animals engage in when they have conflicting drives .\n if we take our example from a minute ago ,  if the bird is afraid of its mate ,  it's conflicted .\n it wants to mate but it's also afraid and wants to run away .\n so ,  instead ,  it starts grooming itself .\n so ,  the displacement activity ,  the grooming ,  the straightening of its feathers ,  seems to be an irrelevant behavior .\n so ,  what do you think another example of a displacement activity might be ?\n how about an animal that ,  um ,  instead of fighting its enemy or running away ,  it attacks a plant or a bush ?\n that's really good suggestion ,  karl .\n but that's called  redirecting  .\n the animal is redirecting its behavior to another object ,  in this case ,  the plant or the bush .\n but that's not an irrelevant or inappropriate behavior .\n the behavior makes sense .\n it's appropriate under the circumstances .\n but what doesn't make sense is the object the behavior's directed towards .\n ok ,  who else ?\n carol ?\n i think i read in another class about an experiment where an object that the animal was afraid of was put next to its food   next to the animal's food .\n and the animal ,  it was conflicted between confronting the object and eating the food ,  so instead ,  it just fell asleep .\n like that ?\n that's exactly what i mean .\n displacement occurs because the animal's got two conflicting drives   two competing urges ,  in this case ,  fear and hunger .\n and what happens is ,  they inhibit each other ,  they cancel each other out in a way ,  and a third seemingly irrelevant behavior surfaces through a process that we call  disinhibition  .\n now ,  in disinhibition ,  the basic idea is that two drives that seem to inhibit ,  to hold back ,  a third drive .\n well ,  well ,  they're getting in a way of each other in a  in a conflict situation and somehow lose control ,  lose their inhibiting effect on that third behavior ,  which means that the third drive surfaces ,  it's expressed in the animal's behavior .\n now ,  these displacement activities can include feeding ,  drinking ,  grooming ,  even sleeping .\n these are what we call  comfort behavior  .\n so why do you think displacement activities are so often comfort behaviors ,  such as grooming ?\n maybe because it's easy for them to do ?\n i mean ,  grooming is like one of the most accessible things an animal can do .\n it's something they do all the time ,  and they have the stimulus right there on the outside of their bodies in order to do the grooming ,  or if food is right in front of them .\n basically ,  they don't have to think very much about those behaviors .\n professor ,  isn't it possible that animals groom because they've got messed up a little from fighting or mating ?\n i mean if a bird's feathers get ruffled or an animal's fur ,  maybe it's not so strange for them to stop and tidy themselves up at that point .\n that's another possible reason although it doesn't necessarily explain other behaviors such as eating ,  drinking or sleeping .\n what's interesting is that studies have been done that suggest that the animal's environment may play a part in determining what kind of behavior it displays .\n for example ,  there's a bird ,  the  wood thrush  ,  anyway ,  when the  wood thrush  is in an attack escape conflict ,  that is ,  it's caught between the two urges to escape from or to attack an enemy ,  if it's sitting on a horizontal branch ,  it'll wipe its beak on its perch .\n if it's sitting on a vertical branch ,  it'll groom its breast feathers .\n the immediate environment of the bird ,  its immediate ,  um ,  its relationship to its immediate environment seems to play a part in which behavior will display .", "context_len": 821, "questions": ["Question: why does the professor mention the wood thrush?

{"context": " all right ,  so let me close today's class with some thoughts to keep in mind while you are doing tonight's assignment .\n you will be reading one of ralph waldo emerson's best known essays  self reliance  and comparing it with his poems and other works .\n i think this essay has the potential to be quite meaningful for all of you as young people who probably wonder about things like truth and where your lives are going   all sorts of profound questions .\n knowing something about emerson's philosophies will help you when you read  self reliance  .\n and basically ,  one of the main beliefs that he had was about truth .\n not that it's something that we can be taught ,  emerson says it's found within ourselves .\n so this truth ,  the idea that it's in each one of us ,  is one of the first points that you'll see emerson making in this essay .\n it's a bit abstract but he's very into uh  into each person believing his or her own thought ,  believing in yourself ,  the thought or conviction that's true for you .\n but actually ,  he ties that in with a sort of  universal truth    something that everyone knows but doesn't realize they know .\n most of us are in touch with ourselves in a way ,  so we just aren't capable of recognizing profound truth .\n it takes geniuses ,  people like ,  say ,  shakespeare ,  who're unique because when they have a glimpse of this truth ,  this universal truth ,  they pay attention to it and express it and don't just dismiss it like most people do .\n so emerson is really into each individual believing in and trusting him or herself .\n you'll see that he writes about ,  well ,  first ,  conformity .\n he criticizes that people of his time for abandoning their own minds and their own wills for the sake of conformity and consistency .\n they try to fit in with the rest of the world even though it's at odds with their beliefs and their identities .\n therefore ,  it's best to be a non conformist   to do your own thing ,  not worrying about what other people think .\n that's an important point .\n he really drives this argument home throughout the essay .\n when you are reading ,  i want you to think about that and why that kind of thought would be relevant to the readers of his time .\n remember this is 1838 ,  self reliance  was a novel idea at the time and the united states citizens were less secure about themselves as individuals and as americans .\n the country as a whole was trying to define itself .\n emerson wanted to give people something to really think about ,  help them find their own way and what it meant to be who they were .\n so that's something that i think is definitely as relevant today as it was then ,  probably ,  um ,  especially among young adults like yourselves ,  you know ,  uh ,  college being a time to sort of really think about who you are and where you're going .\n now ,  we already said that emerson really emphasizes non conformity ,  right ?\n as a way to sort of not lose your own self and identity in the world ,  to have your own truth and not be afraid to listen to it .\n well ,  he takes this a step further .\n not conforming also means ,  uh ,  not conforming with yourself or your past .\n what does that mean ?\n well ,  if you've always been a certain way or done a certain thing ,  but it's not working for you any more ,  or you're not content ,  emerson says that it'd be foolish to be consistent even with our own past .\n focus on the future ,   he says ,   that's what matters more .\n inconsistency is good .\n he talks about a ship's voyage and this is one of the most famous bits of the essay   how the best voyage is made up of zigzag lines .\n up close ,  it seems a little all over the place ,  but from farther away ,  the true path shows and in the end it justifies all the turns along the way .\n so ,  don't worry if you are not sure where you're headed or what your long term goals are .\n stay true to yourself and it'll make sense in the end .\n i mean ,  i can attest to that .\n before i was a literature professor ,  i was an accountant .\n before that ,  i was a newspaper reporter .\n my life is taking some pretty interesting turns and here i am ,  very happy with my experiences and where they've brought me .\n if you rely on yourself and trust your own talents ,  your own interest ,  don't worry ,  your path will make sense in the end .", "context_len": 883, "questions": ["Question: what is the main purpose of the lecture?

{"context": " have you ever heard the one about alligators living in new york sewers ?\n the story goes like this  a family went on vacation in florida and bought a couple of baby alligators as presents for their children ,  then returned from vacation to new york ,  bringing the alligators home with them as pets .\n but the alligators would escape and find their way into the new york sewer system where they started reproducing ,  grew to huge sizes and now strike fear into sewer workers .\n have you heard this story ?\n well ,  it isn't true and it never happened .\n but despite that ,  the story has been around since the 193's .\n or how about the song  twinkle ,  twinkle little star  ,  you know ,   twinkle ,  twinkle ,  little star ,  how i wonder what you are  .\n well we've all heard this song .\n where am i going with this ?\n well ,  both the song and the story are examples of memes .\n and that's what we would talk about ,  the theory of memes .\n a meme is defined as a piece of information copied from person to person .\n by this definition ,  most of what you know ,  ideas ,  skills ,  stories ,  songs are memes .\n all the words you know ,  all the scientific theories you've learned ,  the rules your parents taught you to observe ,  all are memes that have been passed on from person to person .\n so what ?\n you may say .\n passing on ideas from one person to another is nothing new .\n well ,  the whole point of defining this familiar process as transmission of memes is so that we can explore its analogy with the transmission of genes .\n as you know ,  all living organisms pass on biological information through the genes .\n what's a gene ?\n a gene is a piece of biological information that gets copied or replicated ,  and the copy or replica is passed on to the new generation .\n so genes are defined as replicators .\n genes are replicators that pass on information about properties and characteristics of organisms .\n by analogy ,  memes also get replicated and in the process pass on cultural information from person to person ,  generation to generation .\n so memes are also replicators .\n to be a successful replicator ,  there are three key characteristics  longevity ,  fecundity and fidelity .\n let's take a closer look .\n first ,  longevity .\n a replicator must exist long enough to be able to get copied ,  and transfer its information .\n clearly ,  the longer a replicator survives ,  the better its chances of getting its message copied and passed on .\n so longevity is a key characteristic of a replicator .\n if you take the alligator story ,  it can exist for a long time in individual memory ,  let's say ,  my memory .\n i can tell you the story now or ten years from now ,  the same with the twinkle ,  twinkle song .\n so these memes have longevity because they are memorable for one reason or another .\n next ,  fecundity .\n fecundity is the ability to reproduce in large numbers .\n for example ,  the common housefly reproduces by laying several thousand eggs ,  so each fly gene gets copied thousands of times .\n memes ,  well ,  they can be reproduced in large numbers as well .\n how many times have you sung the twinkle ,  twinkle song  to someone ?\n each time you replicated that song ,  and maybe passed it along to someone who did not know it yet ,  a small child maybe .\n and finally ,  fidelity .\n fidelity means accuracy of the copying process .\n we know fidelity is an essential principle of genetic transmission .\n if a copy of a gene is a bit different from the original ,  that's called a genetic mutation .\n and mutations are usually bad news .\n an organism often cannot survive with a mutated gene .\n and so a gene usually cannot be passed on ,  unless it's an exact copy .\n for memes however ,  fidelity is not always so important .\n for example ,  if you tell someone the alligator story i told you today ,  it probably won't be word for word exactly as i said it .\n still ,  it will be basically the same story ,  and the person who hears the story will be able to pass it along .\n other memes are replicated with higher fidelity though ,  like the twinkle ,  twinkle song .\n it had the exact same words 2  years ago as it does now .\n well ,  that's because we see songs as something that has to be performed accurately each time .\n if you change a word ,  the others will usually bring you in line .\n they'll say ,   that's not how you sing it  ,  right ?\n so ,  you can see how looking at pieces of cultural information as replicators ,  as memes ,  and analyzing them in terms of longevity ,  fecundity and fidelity ,  we can gain some insight about how they spread ,  persist or change  .", "context_len": 903, "questions": ["Question: what does the professor compare to a housefly laying many eggs?

{"context": " now when i mention the terms  boom and bust  ,  what does that bring to mind ?\n the dot com crash of the  9's .\n ok .\n the boom in the late 199's when all those new internet companies sprang up and were then sold for huge amounts of money .\n then the bust around 2    2  1 when many of those same internet companies went out of business .\n of course ,  booms aren't always followed by busts .\n we've certainly seen times when local economies expanded rapidly for a while and then went back to a normal pace of growth .\n but ,  there's a type of rapid expansion ,  what might be called a hysterical or irrational boom that pretty much always leads to a bust .\n see ,  people often create and intensify a boom when they get carried away by some new industry that seems like it will make them lots of money fast .\n you'd think that by the 9's ,  people would have learned from the past .\n if they did ,  well ,  look at tulips .\n tulips ?\n you mean like the flower ?\n exactly .\n for instance ,  do you have any idea where tulips are from ?\n originally i mean .\n well ,  the netherlands ,  right ?\n that's what most people think ,  but no .\n they are not native to the netherlands ,  or even europe .\n tulips actually hail from an area that chinese call the celestial mountains in central asia .\n a very remote mountainous region .\n it was turkish nomads who first discovered tulips and spread them slowly westward .\n now ,  around the 16th century ,  europeans were traveling to istanbul and turkey as merchants and diplomats .\n and the turks often gave the europeans tulip bulbs as gifts which they would carry home with them .\n for the europeans ,  tulips were totally unheard of .\n er a great novelty .\n the first bulb to show up in the netherlands ,  the merchant who received them roasted and ate them !\n he thought they were kind of onion .\n it turns out that the netherlands was an ideal country for growing tulips .\n it had the right kind of sandy soil for one thing ,  but also ,  it was a wealthy nation with a growing economy ,  willing to spend lots of money on new exotic things .\n plus ,  the dutch had a history of gardening .\n wealthy people would compete ,  spending enormous amounts of money to buy the rarest flowers for their gardens .\n soon tulips were beginning to show up in different colors as growers tried to breed them specifically for colors which would make them even more valuable .\n but they were never completely sure what they would get .\n some of the most prized tulips were white with purple streaks ,  or red with yellow streaks on the petals ,  even a dark purple tulip that was very much prized .\n what happened then was a craze for these specialized tulips .\n we called that craze  tulip mania  .\n so ,  here we've got all the conditions for an irrational boom  a prospering economy ,  so more people had more disposable income money to spend on luxuries ,  but they weren't experienced at investing their new wealth .\n then along comes a thrilling new commodity .\n sure the first specimens were just plain old red tulips ,  but they could be bred into some extraordinary variations ,  like the dark purple tulip .\n and finally ,  you have an unregulated market place ,  no government constraints ,  where prices could explode .\n and explode they did ,  starting in the 163's .\n there was always much more demand for tulips than supply .\n tulips didn't bloom frequently like roses .\n tulips bloomed once in the early spring .\n and that was it for the year .\n eventually ,  specially bred multicolored tulips became so valuable ,  well ,  according to records ,  one tulip bulb was worth 24 tons of wheat ,  or a thousand pounds of cheese .\n one particular tulip bulb was sold and exchanged for a small ship .\n in other words ,  tulips were literally worth their weight in gold .\n as demand grew ,  people began selling promissory notes guaranteeing the future delivery of prized tulip bulbs .\n the buyers of these pieces of paper would resell the notes at marked up prices .\n these promissory notes kept changing hands from buyer to buyer until the tulip was ready for delivery .\n but it was all pure speculation because as i said ,  there was no way to know if the bulb was really going to produce the variety ,  the color that was promised .\n but that didn't matter to the owner of the note .\n the owner only cared about having that piece of paper so it could be traded later at a profit .\n and people were borrowing ,  mortgaging their homes in many cases to obtain those bits of paper because they were sure they found an easy way to make money .\n so now ,  you've got all the ingredients for a huge bust .\n and bust it did ,  when one cold february morning in 1637 ,  a group of bulb traders got together and discovered that suddenly there were no bidders .\n nobody wanted to buy .\n panic spread like wild fire and the tulip market collapsed

{"context": " professor  the 19th century was the time that saw what we called realism developed in the european theater .\n um  to understand this though ,  we first need to look at an earlier form of drama known as the well made play ,  which basically was a pattern for constructing plays ,  plays that   uh   beginning with some early 19th century comedies in france proved very successful commercially .\n the dramatic devices used here weren't actually anything new .\n they had been around for centuries .\n but the formula for a well made play required that the certain of these elements be included in a particular order .\n and most importantly ,  that everything in the plays be logically connected .\n in fact ,  some of these playwrights would start by writing the end of a play and work backward toward the beginning ,  just to make sure each event led logically from what had gone before .\n ok ,  so what are the necessary elements of a well made play ?\n well ,  the first is logical exposition .\n exposition is whatever background information you have to reveal to the audience .\n so ,  they'll understand what is going on .\n before this time ,  exposition might have come from actors simply giving speeches .\n someone might walk out on a stage and say   in fair verona where we lay our scene !\n and then tell all about the feuding families of romeo and juliet .\n but for the well made play ,  even the exposition had to be logical ,  believable .\n so ,  for example ,  you might have two servants gossiping as they are cleaning the house .\n and one says ,  oh ,  what a shame the master's son is still not married .\n and the other might mention a rumor about a mysterious gentleman who's just moved into town with his beautiful daughter .\n these comments are part of the play's logical exposition .\n the next key element of the a well made play is referred to as the inciting incident .\n after we have the background information ,  we need a key moment that gets things moving ,  that really makes the audience interested in what happens to the characters we just heard about .\n so ,  for example ,  after the two servants reveal all this background information ,  we meet the young man .\n just as he first lays eyes on the beautiful young woman ,  and immediately falls in love .\n this is the inciting incident .\n it sets off ,  the plot of the play .\n now ,  the plot of a well made play is usually driven by secrets .\n things that the audience knows ,  but the characters often don't know .\n so ,  for example ,  the audience learns through a letter or through someone else's conversation who this mysterious gentleman is and why he left the town many years before .\n but the young man doesn't know about this .\n and the woman doesn't understand the ancient connection between her family and his .\n and before the secrets are revealed to the main characters ,  the plot of the play proceeds as a series of sort of up and down moments .\n for example ,  the woman first appears not to even notice the young man ,  and it seems to him like the end of the world .\n but then ,  he learns that she actually wants to meet him too .\n so ,  life is wonderful .\n then ,  if he tries to talk with her ,  maybe her father get furious ,  for no apparent reason .\n so ,  they can't see each other .\n but ,  just as the young man has almost lost all hope ,  he finds out ,  well you get the idea ,  the reversals of fortune continue ,  increasing the audience's tension and excitement ,  making them wonder if everything is going to come out okay or not .\n next comesan element known as the  obligatory scene .\n it's a scene ,  a moment in which all the secrets are revealed .\n and generally ,  things turn out well for the hero and others we care about ,  a happy ending of some sort .\n this became so popular that a playwright almost had to include it in every play ,  which is why it's called  the obligatory scene .\n and that's followed by the final dramatic element   the denouement or the resolution ,  when all the loose ends have to be tied up in a logical way .\n remember ,  the obligatory scene gives the audience emotional pleasure .\n but the denouement offers the audience a logical conclusion .\n that's the subtle distinction we need to try very hard to keep in mind .\n so ,  as i said ,  the well made play ,  this form of playwriting ,  became the basis for realism in drama ,  and for a lot of very popular 19th century plays .\n and also ,  a pattern we find in the plots of many later plays and even movies that we see today .", "context_len": 881, "questions": ["Question: what does the professor imply about the obligatory scene and the denouncement?

{"context": " last time ,  we started to talk about glaciers and how these masses of ice form from crystallized snow ,  and some of you were amazed at how huge some of these glaciers are .\n now ,  even though it may be difficult to understand how a huge mass of ice can move or flow ,  it's another word for it ,  it's really known that no secret that the glaciers flow because of gravity .\n but how they flow ,  the way they flow ,  needs some explaining .\n now ,  the first type of glacier flow is called  basal slip .\n basal slip or sliding as it's often called ,  basically refers to the slipping or sliding of a glacier across bedrock ,  actually across a thin layer of water on top of the bedrock .\n so ,  this process shouldn't be too hard to imagine .\n what happens is that the ice at the base of the glacier is under a great deal of pressure   the pressure coming from the weight of the overlying ice .\n and you probably know that under pressure ,  the melting temperature of water ,  of the ice i mean ,  is reduced .\n so ,  ice at the base of the glacier melts ,  even though it's below zero degree celsius .\n and this results in a thin layer of water between the glacier and the ground .\n this layer of water reduces friction is   is like a lubricant .\n and it allows the glacier to slide or slip over the bedrock .\n ok ?\n now the next type of movement we will talk about is called  deformation .\n you v already known that ice is brittle ,  if you hit it with a hammer ,  it will shatter like glass .\n but ice is also plastic ,  it can change shape without breaking .\n if you leave ,  for example ,  a bar of ice supported only at one end ,  the end ,  the unsupported end will deform under its own weight ,  it'll kind of flatten out at one end ,  get distorted ,  deformed .\n think of deformation as a very slow oozing .\n depending on the stresses on the glacier ,  the ice crystal within it reorganize .\n and during this re organization the ice crystals realign in a way that allows them to slide pass each other .\n and so the glacier oozes downhill without any ice actually melting .\n now ,  there are a couple of factors that affect the amount of deformation that takes place or the speed of the glacier's movement for example .\n deformation is more likely to occur the thicker the ice is ,  because of the gravity of the weight of the ice .\n and temperature also plays a part here ,  in that cold ice does not move as easily as ice that is close to the melting point ,  in fact ,  it is not too different from  the way oil is ,  thicker at lower temperatures .\n so ,  if you have a glacier in a slightly warmer region ,  it will flow faster than a glacier in a cooler region .\n ok ,  um  now ,  i'd like to touch briefly on extension and compression .\n your textbook includes these as types ,  as a particular type of glacier movement ,  but you will see that there are  as many textbooks that omit it as a type of movement as include it .\n and i might not include it right now ,  if it weren't in your textbook .\n but ,  basically ,  the upper parts of glaciers have less pressure on them .\n so ,  they don't deform easily ,  they tend to be more brittle .\n and crevasses can form in this upper layers of the glacier .\n when the glacier comes into contact with bedrock walls or is otherwise under some kind of stress ,  but can't deform quickly enough .\n so ,  the ice would expand or constrict ,  and that can cause big fissures big cracks to form in the surface layers of the ice ,  and that brittle surface ice moving is sometimes considered a type of glacier movement depending on which source you are consulting .\n now ,  as you probably know ,  glaciers generally move really slowly .\n but sometimes ,  they experience surges ,  and during these surges ,  in some places ,  they can move at speeds as high as 7    meters per year .\n now ,  speeds like that are pretty unusual ,  hundreds of times faster than the regular movement of glaciers ,  but you can actually see glacier move during these surges ,  though it is rare .", "context_len": 807, "questions": ["Question: what is the lecture mainly about?

{"context": " ok .\n well ,  last time we talked about passive habitat selection ,  like plants for example ,  they don't make active choices about where to grow .\n they are dispersed by some other agent ,  like the wind .\n and if the seeds land in a suitable habitat ,  they do well and reproduce .\n with active habitat selection ,  an organism is able to physically select where to live and breed .\n and because an animal's breeding habitat is so important ,  we'd expect animal species to have developed preferences for particular types of habitats ,  places where their offspring have the best chance of survival .\n so let's look at the effect this preference can have by looking at some examples .\n but first let's recap .\n what do we mean by habitat ?\n frank ?\n well ,  it's basically the place or environment where an organism normally lives and grows .\n right ,  and as we v discussed ,  there are some key elements that a habitat must contain ,  food obviously ,  water ,  it's got to have the right climate and spaces for physical protection .\n and we saw how important habitat selection is when we look at habitats where some of these factors are removed ,  perhaps through habitat destruction .\n i just read about a shorebird ,  the plover .\n the plover lives by the ocean and feeds on small shellfish ,  insects and plants .\n it blends in with the sand ,  so it's well camouflaged from predator birds above .\n but it lays its eggs in shallow depressions in the sand with very little protection around them .\n so if there are people or dogs on the beach ,  the eggs and fledglings in the nests are really vulnerable .\n out in california where there has been a lot of human development by the ocean .\n the plovers are now a threatened species .\n so conservationists tried to recreate a new habitat for them .\n they made artificial beaches and sand bars in areas inaccessible to people and dogs .\n and the plover population is up quite a bit in those places .\n ok .\n that is an instance where a habitat is made less suitable .\n but now ,  what about cases where an animal exhibits a clear choice between two suitable habitats ?\n in cases like that ,  does the preference matter ?\n well ,  let's look at the blue warbler .\n the blue warbler is a songbird that lives in north america .\n they clearly prefer hard wood forests with dense shrubs ,  bushes underneath the trees .\n they actually nest in the shrubs ,  not the trees .\n so they're pretty close to the ground ,  but these warblers also nest in forests that have low shrub density .\n it is usually the younger warblers that nest in these areas because the preferred spots where there are a lot of shrubs are taken by the older ,  more dominant birds .\n and the choice of habitat seems to affect reproductive success .\n because the older ,  more experienced birds who nest in the high density shrub areas have significantly more offspring than those in low density areas ,  which suggests that the choice of where to nest does have an impact on the number of chicks they have .\n but a preferred environment doesn't always seem to correlate with greater reproductive success .\n for example ,  in europe ,  studies have been done of blackcap warblers .\n we just call them blackcaps .\n the blackcap can be found in two different environments .\n their preferred habitat is forests near the edge of streams .\n however ,  blackcaps also live in pine woods away from water .\n studies have been done on the reproductive success rates for the birds in both areas ,  and the result showed surprisingly that the reproductive success was essentially the same in both areas    the preferred and the second choice habitat .\n well .\n why ?\n it turned out that there were actually four times as many bird pairs or couples living in the stream edge habitat compared to the area away from the stream .\n so this stream edge area had a much denser population ,  which meant more members of the same species competing for resources ,  wanting to feed on the same things or build their nests in the same places ,  which lower the suitability of the prime habitat even though it's their preferred habitat .\n so the results of the study suggest that when the number of the competitors in the prime habitat reaches a certain point ,  the second rank habitat becomes just as successful as the prime habitat ,  just because there are fewer members of the same species living there .\n so it looks like competition for resources is another important factor in determining if a particular habitat is suitable .", "context_len": 839, "questions": ["Question: according to the professor , why did some blackcaps choose a secondary habitat?

{"context": " as we have seen ,  the second half of the 18th century was an exciting time in europe  it was not only an age of great invention ,  but social changes also led to a rise in all sorts of entertainment ,  from reading to museums ,  to travel .\n and finding himself in the middle of this excitement was an accomplished french painter named philippe jacques de loutherbourg .\n loutherbourg arrived in england in 1771 ,  and immediately went to work as a set designer at the famous drury lane theater in london .\n from his first shows ,  loutherbourg showed a knack for imagination and stage design ,  all in the interest of creating illusions that allowed the audience to suspend disbelief completely .\n he accomplished this by giving the stage a greater feeling of depth ,  which he did by cutting up some of the rigid background scenery ,  and placing it at various angles and distances from the audience .\n another realistic touch was using three dimensional objects on the set ,  like rocks and bushes as opposed to two dimensional painted scenery .\n he also paid much more attention to lighting and sound than had been done before .\n now ,  these sets were so elaborate that many people attended the theater more for them than for the actors or the story .\n at the time ,  people were wild for travel and for experiencing new places  but not everyone could afford it .\n loutherbourg outdid himself ,  however ,  with a show that he set up in his own home .\n he called it the  eidophusikon  .\n eidophusikon  means something like representation of nature ,  and that's exactly what he intended to do  create realistic moving scenes that change before the audiences  eyes .\n in this ,  he synthesized all his tricks from drury lane  mechanical motions ,  sound ,  light ,  other special effects to create ,  if you will ,  an early multimedia production .\n the  eidophusikon  was loutherbourg's attempt to release painting from the constraints of the picture frame .\n after all ,  even the most action filled exciting painting can represent only one moment in time  and any illusion of movement is gone after the first glance .\n but loutherbourg ,  like other contemporary painters ,  wanted to add the dimension of time to his paintings .\n you know ,  the popular thinking is that loutherbourg was influenced by landscape painting .\n but why can't we say that the  eidophusikon  actually influenced the painters ?\n at the very least we have to consider that it was more    it was more of a mutual thing .\n we know ,  for example ,  that the important english landscape painter thomas gainsborough attended almost all of the early performances ,  and his later paintings are notable for their increased color and dynamic use of light .\n loutherbourg's influence on the theater though ,  he was incredibly influential  the way he brought together design and lighting and sound as a unified feature of the stage ,  can easily be seen in english theater's subsequent emphasis on lighting and motion .\n now ,  the  eidophusikon  stage was actually a box  a few meters wide ,  a couple meters tall and a couple meters deep .\n that is ,  the action took place within this box .\n this was much smaller of course than the usual stage .\n but ,  it also allowed loutherbourg to concentrate the lighting to better effect .\n also ,  the audience was in the dark ,  which wouldn't be a common feature of the theater until a hundred years later .\n the show consisted of a series of scenes ,  for example ,  a view of london from sunrise that changes as the day moves on  mechanical figures ,  such as cattle ,  moved across the scene ,  and ships sailed along the river .\n but what really got people was the attention to detail ,  much like his work at drury lane .\n so ,  for example ,  he painted very realistic ships ,  and varied their size depending on their distance from the audience .\n small boats moved more quickly across the foreground than larger ones did that were closer to the horizon .\n other effects ,  like waves ,  were also very convincing .\n they reflected sunlight or moonlight depending on the time of day or night .\n even the colors changed as they would in nature .\n sound and light were important in making his productions realistic .\n he used a great number of lamps ,  and he was able to change colors of light by using variously colored pieces of glass ,  to create effects like passing clouds that suddenly change in color .\n furthermore ,  he used effects to make patterns of shadow and light ,  rather than using the uniform lighting that was common at the time .\n and many of the sound effects he pioneered are still in use today ,  like creating thunder by pulling on one of the corners of a thin copper sheet .\n one of his most popular scenes was of a storm .\n and there is a story that on one occasion ,  an actual storm passed over head during the show .\n and some people went outside ,  and they claimed loutherbourg's thunder was actually better than the real thunder .", "context_len": 911, "questions": ["Question: what are two notable features of the eidophusikon?

{"context": " ok ,  so last time ,  we covered the dances honey bees do to indicate where food can be found and the calls and songs of different types of birds .\n today ,  i'd like to look at some communication systems found in mammals ,  particularly in primates ,  such as orangutans ,  chimpanzees ,  gorillas   yes ,  thomas ?\n excuse me ,   .\n but when you talk about gorilla language ,  do you mean like ,  those experiments where humans taught them sign language or a language like .\n ok ,  wait just a minute .\n now ,  who in this class heard me use the word  language  ?\n no one i hope .\n what we're talking about here ,  are systems of communication ,  all right ?\n oh ,  sorry ,  communication ,  right .\n but could you maybe ,  like ,  clarify what the difference is ?\n of course ,  that's a fair question .\n ok ,  well ,  to start with ,  let's make it clear that language is a type of communication ,  not the other way around .\n ok ,  so all communication systems ,  language included ,  have certain features in common .\n for example ,  the signals used to communicate from the bee's dance movements ,  to the word and sentences found in human languages .\n all these signals convey meaning .\n and all communication systems serve a purpose ,  a pragmatic function of some sort .\n warning of danger perhaps or offering other needed information .\n but there're several features peculiar to human language that have ,  for the most part ,  never been found in the communication system of any other species .\n for one thing ,  learn ability .\n animals have instinctive communication systems .\n when a dog ,  a puppy gets to certain age ,  it's able to bark .\n it barks without having to learn how from other dogs ,  it just barks .\n but much of human language has to be learned from other humans .\n what else makes human language unique ?\n what makes it different from animal communication ?\n deborah ?\n how about grammar ?\n like having verbs ,  nouns ,  adjectives ?\n ok ,  that's another feature .\n and it's a good example .\n i mean i mention this  cause like in my biology class last year ,  i kind of remember talking about a study on prairie dogs ,  where ,  i think the researchers claimed that the warning cries of prairie dogs constitute language ,  because they have these different parts of speech .\n you know ,  like nouns ,  to name the type of predator they spotted ,  adjectives to describe its size and shape ,  verbs   ,  but now it seems like .\n all right ,  hold on a moment .\n i'm familiar with the study you're talking about .\n and for those of you who don't know ,  prairie dogs are not actually dogs .\n they're a type of rodent who ,  who burrow in the ground in the grasslands of the western united states and mexico .\n in this study ,  the researchers looked at the high pitched barks a prairie dog makes when it spots predator .\n and from this they made some pretty   ,  well ,  they made some claims about these calls qualifying as an actual language ,  with its own primitive grammar .\n but actually ,  these warning calls are no different from those found among certain types of monkeys .\n and ,  well ,  let's not even get into the question of whether concepts like noun and verb can be meaningfully applied to animal communication .\n another thing that distinguishes a real language is a property we call  discreteness  .\n in other words ,  messages are built up out of smaller parts ,  sentences out of words ,  words out of individual sounds ,  etc .\n now maybe you could say that the prairie dog's message is built from smaller parts ,  like say for example ,  our prairie dog spots a predator ,  a big coyote approaching rapidly .\n so the prairie dog makes a call that means  coyote  ,  then one that means  large  ,  and then another one to indicate its speed .\n but do you really suppose it makes any difference what order these calls come in ?\n no .\n but the discrete units that make up language can be put together in different ways .\n those smaller parts can be used to form an infinite number of messages ,  including messages that are completely novel ,  that have never been expressed before .\n for example ,  we can differentiate between   a large coyote moves fast .\n and say  move the large coyote fast .\n or  move fast ,  large coyote .\n ,  and i truly doubt whether anyone has ever uttered either of these sentences before .\n human language is productive ,  an open ended communication system ,  whereas no other communication system has this property .\n and another feature of language that's not displayed by any form of animal communication is what we call  displacement  .\n that is ,  language is abstract enough that we can talk about things

{"context": " ok just before the end of the last class ,  we started talking about trace metals ,  metals found in living organisms in very small quantities that serve an important biological ,  important nutritive function in those organisms and one trace metal that serves a nutritive function is zinc zinc assists in a number of processes in humans ,  but we are going to focus on just one ,  one that applies to a number of organisms ,  not just humans see ,  zinc plays a major role in carbon cycling ,  the conversion of various kinds of molecules with carbon ,  iike carbon dioxide ,  into other kinds of molecules with carbon that organisms can use so ,  take respiration our bodies ,  our cells produce carbon dioxide when theybreak down sugars we need to get the co2 out of our bodies ,  so the co2 is converted into carbonic acid ,  which the blood is able to carry to the lungs once the carbonic acid reaches the lungs ,  it's converted back into carbon dioxide so that we can breathe it out now ,  this whole conversion process relies on a particular enzyme uh ,  who remembers what an enzyme is ?\n bob ?\n uh ,  it's a protein ,  a specific kind of protein ,  one that speeds up chemical reactions .\n exactly different enzymes assist in different chemical reactions now ,  the one that speeds up the conversion of carbon dioxide has zinc in it so this zinc enzyme is critical for getting co2 out of our bodies through the lungs and it's also extremely important for plants bob ,  can you tell us why ?\n for making food ,  for photosynthesis ?\n exactly for photosynthesis plants also convert carbon dioxide into different forms of carbon containing molecules and the conversion process used relies on the very same enzyme that works in humans so zinc is also important for plants ok but zinc is scarce in certain environments and it's particularly scarce in waters near the surface of rivers and lakes and shallower parts of oceans ,  which might make us wonder how plants could live there at all in fact ,  there are a lot of marine plants that survive ,  that grow and reproduce in surface waters in particular ,  there are a lot of diatoms diatoms are microscopic ,  photosynthetic organisms and they are a major source of food for other organisms in the ocean there are a number of different types of diatoms ,  and ,  well ,  diatoms play a very important role in the carbon cycling process ,  because they help make carbon available to other organisms in deeper parts of the ocean the carbon that these diatoms use in photosynthesis is transferred to other parts of the ocean when the diatoms are eaten ,  say ,  by a fish that absorbs the carbon and then swims to another part of the ocean ,  or when diatoms die and fall to the ocean floor .\n so how did diatoms survive if zinc is so scarce ?\n well ,  recently researchers discovered that a specific type of diatom makes a different enzyme that serves the same purpose but this enzyme doesn't contain zinc instead this new enzyme incorporates another trace metal ,  cadmium kelly ,  you've got a question ?\n yeah i thought cadmium was toxic didn't you say that ?\n it is poisonous to humans uh .\n actually ,  we used to think that it was toxic to all biological life ,  that it didn't serve any biological purpose but new study suggests that cadmium can actually substitute for zinc ,  that organisms can use it instead of zinc when there isn't enough zinc in their environment now ,  the discovery of this cadmium based enzyme is really important for a number of reasons it's actually the first enzyme we have discovered that uses cadmium so it's possible that other not so typical trace metals may be used in chemical processes ,  that marine organisms might make enzymes from other trace metals when the essential one is scarce and there may be other types of diatoms that use cadmiumbut there's something else to think about what is one of the most common greenhouse gases in our atmosphere ,  one of the major culprits in global warming carbon dioxide ,  right ?\n now ,  if all these diatoms are taking carbon dioxide from the surface ,  converting it and transporting it to the bottom of the ocean ,  well ,  maybe there's more to that whole process ,  that cycle ,  something that we've overlooked so further research might tell us more about these warming cycles too  .", "context_len": 801, "questions": ["Question: what is the lecture mainly about?

{"context": " k we have been looking at some of the smaller members of our solar system ,  comets you already know about the structure of comets let's continue our discussion now by talking about orbits ,  especially those of the so called periodic orbit comets these are the comets that circle around the sun pretty regularly they return again and again ,  predictably ,  after a certain period of time that's why we say their orbits are periodic probably the most famous and brightest of these is halley's comet halley's comet comes from far out in the solar system ,  goes in close to the sun ,  and then out again at its closest approach to the sun ,  halley's comet is about twice as close to the sun as earth is and at its farthest it's about thirty five times farther from the sun than we are ,  which puts it out beyond neptune .\n basically ,  the idea here is that a periodic comet ,  with its very elongated orbit ,  just keeps coming back around again and again with halley's comet ,  well ,  it returns every 75 years ,  roughly but where is halley's comet during most of this time ?\n well ,  like all orbiting bodies ,  a comet moves faster when it's closer to the sun so it only spends about a year or two in our neighborhood ,  inside the orbit of jupiter most of its time is spent way out beyond jupiter's orbit ,  poking along near the farther reaches of it own orbit because of this ,  we can only see halley's for a few months every 75 years ,  first on its way in toward the sun ,  and then on its way out again now ,  you remember from our previous discussion that a comet's nucleus  , its core ,  is made up of ice and dust ,  like a frozen snowball and as it approaches the sun ,  it starts to heat up and some of the ice vaporizes into gas and spreads out from the nucleus the gases that vaporize from the comet ,  the comet never collects them back again ,  so on every orbit ,  the comet leaves part of itself behind ok how old is this solar system  ?\n four and a half billion years remember  ?\n and halley's is going around the sun once every 75 years and losing stuff each time so the comet should be long gone by now ,  right ?\n i mean ,  how come halley's is still there ?\n after four and a half billion years how could it be ?\n well ,  the answer is that this comet hasn't always been in such a short periodic orbit ,  since once a comet gets intoan orbit that keeps it coming in close to the sun quite frequently well ,  that comet's probably not going to be around too much longer .\n so this kind of periodic orbit is only a phase in a comet's life a phase that just precedes its final breakup we've seen comets do that ,  going toward the sun and then come back around  , torn into pieces but lots of comets aren't like that they come in ,  pass behind the sun ,  and then travel back out but with an orbit so large ,  and its farthest place so far away from the sun that we just don't know how far out it goes we just can't determine that very accurately from the close in part of the orbit that we do see so these are often called parabolic orbit comets parabolic means the orbit is open at the far end actually the orbit probably does close and return the comet to the vicinity of the sun eventually ,  but the period might be tens of thousands of years and basically ,  we can't determine it so we just ,  we refer to them as open ended parabolic orbit comets so ,  what can change a comet with one of these long orbits where they only come by the sun occasionally into a much more frequent periodic visitor ?\n well ,  gravitational interaction with planets ,  right ?\n lf a comet on one of these long period orbits at some point comes close to jupiter or saturn or one of the other planets ,  then the pull of that planet's gravity might alter the orbit ,  maybe make it much shorter so this comet ,  if it happens to pass by a planet just the right way ,  it can be drawn into a new orbit ,  one that'll capture it and keep it coming back around the sun much more often  .", "context_len": 814, "questions": ["Question: what is the professor's opinion about the name parabolic orbit comets?

{"context": " so far we have been talking all semester about restoring and preserving pieces of art like ancient frescos early oil paintings etc but although our field is called art conservation it also involves what ?\n um   preserving other types of cultural materials toovery good not just art old artifacts are very valuable when they represent early technologies ,  all contain important historical information in fact let me give you an example you've heard about the greek scholar archimedes who lived more than 2     years ago i am sure archimedes was a great mathematician for example he discovered the formula for the volume of a sphere not much of his work has survived but what has survived is brilliant and then in 19 6 a palimpsest of archimedes  writing was discovered now ,  a palimpsest is a type of manuscript that contains writing that's hidden because something else was written over it later i'll explain in a minute this archimedes palimpsest ,  as it's now called is by far the most important palimpsest anyone has ever seen because it contains the only known existing copy of archimedes treatise ,  called method archimedes shows in it how maths can be applied to physics and physical reasoning back to maths problems ,  which is how he calculated the volume of the sphere for example this maybe commonplace today ,  but was revolutionary in his time a few years ago ,  the palimpsest was sold at an auction for 2 million dollars it could have ended up tucked away in a private collection but fortunately ,  the collector who bought it has agreed to have experts restore every single word archimedes wrote so the contents can be shared with the world and studied but there are two main problems what do you think the first one might be ?\n um well it sounds like it's extremely old so probably some pages are at the point of crumbling into dust ?\n true and some are moldy ,  and some were eaten away at by bookworms this thing's really decayed but on top of that there's another issue and this is the reason why it's a palimpsest you see the text apparently sat around in a library in constantinople until 1229 a'd but then a scribe erased scraped away the writing as clean as he could in order to use the pages to write his own book on why would hedo that ?\n take a guess must have been a paper shortage ?\n well ?\n they used parchment to write on ,  but yes ,  there was a parchment shortage so you are saying the parchment was basically recycled ?\n correct then even later on in the twentieth century ,  a forger paintedancient looking pictures on several of the pages in order to make the book seem older and increase its value so unfortunately ,  that's quite a history but professor wilkens if the scribe scraped away archimedes words and if these paintings covered the pages how can the original work be recovered ?\n ah ,  that's why i am telling you the story that's our task as conservationists ,  isn't it ?\n to find a way there were still faint traces of archimedes words on the pages first we tried to make the archimedes words stand out with a variety of technologies using ultraviolet light but that didn't work on every page but then there was this new idea that came from a scientist studying spinach yes spinach this physicist uwe bergman does research that involves studying iron in spinach he was reading an article about problems with the palimpsest and it said that there is iron in the original archimedes  ink so he came up with an idea to use the same method of looking at iron in spinach to view the iron on the palimpsest pages and his idea worked bergman's technique allows x rays to pass through the forged paintings ,  pass through the scribe's writing to hit the iron traces from the ink of the original archimedes  text and create an image just of the iron on the pages the iron based letters seem to just pop off the page the original text and diagrams emerged line by line diagram after diagram .\n and that's kind of typical of our field there's a lot of interdisciplinary work people from several different fields might beinvolved in working with a single art  .", "context_len": 758, "questions": ["Question: what is the main purpose of the lecture?

{"context": " a mass extinction as when numerous species become extinct over a very short time period ,  short ,  geologically speaking that is ,  like when the dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago .\n and the fossil record ,  it indicates that in all the time that animals have inhabited earth ,  there have been five great mass extinctions ,  dinosaurs being the most recent .\n in each of the others up to half of all land animals and up to 95 percent of marine species disappeared .\n well ,  today we are witnessing a sixth mass extinction ,  but unlike the others ,  the current loss of bio diversity can be traced to human to human activity .\n since the stone age ,  humans have been eliminating species and altering ecosystems with astounding speed .\n countless species have disappeared due to over hunting ,  habitat destruction and habitat fragmentation ,  pollution and other unnatural human causes .\n so ,  as a way of repairing some of that damage ,  a group of conservation biologists has proposed an ambitious ,  or some might say ,  a radical plan ,  involving large vertebrates ,  or  ,  megafauna .\n megafauna include elephants ,  wild horses ,  big cats ,  camels ,  large animals .\n eh ,  actually ,  the proposal focuses on a particular subset of megafauna ,  the kind that lived during the pleistocene epoch .\n ok .\n the pleistocene epoch ,  most commonly known as the ice age ,  stretched from 1 .\n 8 million to 11 , 5   years ago .\n in the americas ,  many megafauna began disappearing by the end of the pleistocene .\n so here's the biologists  idea .\n take a select group of animals ,  megafauna from places like africa and asia ,  and introduce them into other ecosystems similar to their current homes ,  beginning in the united states .\n they call their plan pleistocene rewilding .\n now ,  the advocates of pleistocene rewilding cite two main goals .\n one is to help prevent the extinction of some endangered megafauna by providing new refuges ,  new habitats for them .\n the other is to restore some of the evolutionary and ecological potential that has been lost in north america .\n what do i mean by restore evolutionary potential ?\n well as you know the evolution of any species is largely influenced by its interactions with other species .\n so during the pleistocene epoch  let's take the now extinct american cheetah ,  for instance .\n we believe it played a pivotal role in the evolution of the pronghorn antelope ,  the antelope's amazing speed ,  to be exact ,  because natural selection would favor those antelope that could outrun a cheetah .\n when the american cheetahs disappeared ,  their influence on the evolution of pronghorn and presumably on other prey animals stopped .\n so it is conceivable that the pronghorn antelope would have continued to evolve ,  get faster maybe ,  if the cheetahs were still around .\n that's what's meant by evolutionary potential .\n importing african cheetahs to the western united states could ,  in theory ,  put the pronghorn back onto its  uh ,  natural evolutionary trajectory according to these biologists .\n another example is the interaction of megafauna with local flora ,  in particular ,  plants that rely on animals to disperse their seeds .\n like pleistocene rewilding could spark the re emergence of large seeded american plants ,  such as the maclura tree .\n many types of maclura used to grow in north american ,  buy today ,  just one variety remains and it is found in only two states .\n in the distant past ,  large herbivores like mastodons dispersed maclura seeds ,  each the size of an orange in their droppings .\n well ,  there aren't any mastodons left ,  but there are elephants ,  which descended from mastodons .\n introduce elephants into that ecosystem and they might disperse those large maclura seeds ,  like their ancestors did .\n get the idea ?\n restoring some of the former balance to the ecosystem ?\n but as i alluded to earlier ,  pleistocene rewilding is extremely controversial .\n a big worry is that these transplanted megafauna might devastate plants and animals that are native to the western united states .\n in the years since the pleistocene epoch ,  native species have adapted to the changing environmental there ,  plants ,  smaller animals ,  they have been evolving without megafauna for millennia .\n also ,  animal species that went extinct 11 ,     years ago ,  uh ,  some are quite different genetically from their modern day counterparts ,  like elephants don't have thick coasts like their mastodon ancestors do when they graze the prairies of the america west during the ice age .\n granted ,  the climate today is not as cold as it was in the pleistocene .\n but winters on the prairie can still get pretty harsh today .\n and there are many more considerations .\n well ,  you see how complex this is .\n if you think about it though ,  the core problem with this sixth mass extinction is human interference .\n pleistocene rewilding is based on good intentions ,  but you know ,  it probably would just be more of the same thing .", "context_len": 894, "questions": ["Question: what is the
