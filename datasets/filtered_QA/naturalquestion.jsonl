With this chaos , the totalitarian , theonomic government of `` Gilead '' establishes rule in the former United States in the aftermath of a civil war . Society is organized by power - hungry leaders along with a new , militarized , hierarchical regime of fanaticism and newly created social classes , in which women are brutally subjugated , and by law are not allowed to work , own property , handle money , or read . </P> <P> Worldwide infertility has resulted in the conscription of the few remaining fertile women in Gilead , called `` Handmaids '' , according to an extremist interpretation of the Biblical account of Bilhah . They are assigned to the homes of the ruling elite , where they must submit to ritualized rape by their male masters in order to become pregnant and bear children for those men and their wives . </P> <P> Alongside the Handmaids , much of society is now grouped into classes that dictate their freedoms and duties . Women are divided into a small range of social categories , each one signified by a plain dress in a specific color : Handmaids wear red , Marthas ( who are housekeepers and cooks , named after the biblical figure ) wear green , and Wives ( who are expected to run their households ) wear blue and turquoise . </P> <P> Econowives , the lower - class women who still have minimal agency , are a sort of mixture of all these categories , and they wear gray ( a departure from the book in which Econowives wear clothing striped with the aforementioned colors ) . Women prisoners are called Unwomen and are worked to death clearing toxic waste in the Colonies . </P> <P> Another class of women , Aunts ( who train and oversee the Handmaids ) , wear brown . Additionally , the Eyes are a secret police watching over the general populace for signs of rebellion , Hunters track down people attempting to flee the country , and Jezebels are prostitutes in secret brothels catering to the elite ruling class . </P> <P> June Osborne , renamed Offred ( Elisabeth Moss ) , is the Handmaid assigned to the home of the Gileadan Commander Fred Waterford ( Joseph Fiennes ) and his wife Serena Joy ( Yvonne Strahovski ) . Offred is subject to strict rules and constant scrutiny ; an improper word or deed on her part can lead to brutal punishment . </P> <P> Offred , who is named after her male master ( `` Of Fred '' ) like all Handmaids , was married and had a daughter , a job , a bank account , and her own name and identity in the `` time before '' , but all she can safely do now is follow the rules of Gilead in hopes that she can someday live free again and be reunited with her daughter . The Waterfords , key players in the rise of Gilead , have their own conflicts with the realities of the society they have helped create . </P> <H2> Cast and characters ( edit ) </H2> Main article : List of The Handmaid 's Tale characters <H3> Main ( edit ) </H3> <Ul> <Li> Elisabeth Moss as June Osborne / Offred , a woman who was captured while attempting to escape to Canada with her husband , Luke , and daughter , Hannah .

June advocates for Janine to be able to see the baby , and Serena agrees to ask about it for the baby 's sake . Naomi Putnam dislikes the idea , but she is overruled by her husband , Warren . Serena petitions Fred to allow the sick child to be seen by a Martha who , prior to the Sons of Jacob coup , was one of the nation 's top neonatologists . Fred denies the request , saying that whatever happens to the child must now be left to God 's will . A dismayed Serena forges Fred 's signature to a written order that transfers the Martha to the hospital for a day . Aunt Lydia tells June that she will hold her personally responsible if anything goes wrong with Janine 's visit to the hospital . The neonatologist can find no physical explanation for the child 's deterioration and can recommend no further treatment .

The copper statue , a gift from the people of France to the people of the United States , was designed by French sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and built by Gustave Eiffel . The statue was dedicated on October 28 , 1886 . </P> <P> The Statue of Liberty is a figure of a robed woman representing Libertas , a Roman goddess . She holds a torch above her head with her right hand , and in her left hand carries a tabula ansata inscribed in Roman numerals with `` JULY IV MDCCLXXVI '' ( July 4 , 1776 ) , the date of the U.S. Declaration of Independence . A broken chain lies at her feet . The statue became an icon of freedom and of the United States , and was a welcoming sight to immigrants arriving from abroad . </P> <P> Bartholdi was inspired by a French law professor and politician , Édouard René de Laboulaye , who is said to have commented in 1865 that any monument raised to U.S. independence would properly be a joint project of the French and American peoples . Because of the post-war instability in France , work on the statue did not commence until the early 1870s . In 1875 , Laboulaye proposed that the French finance the statue and the U.S. provide the site and build the pedestal . Bartholdi completed the head and the torch - bearing arm before the statue was fully designed , and these pieces were exhibited for publicity at international expositions . </P> <P> The torch - bearing arm was displayed at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876 , and in Madison Square Park in Manhattan from 1876 to 1882 . Fundraising proved difficult , especially for the Americans , and by 1885 work on the pedestal was threatened by lack of funds . Publisher Joseph Pulitzer , of the New York World , started a drive for donations to finish the project and attracted more than 120,000 contributors , most of whom gave less than a dollar . The statue was built in France , shipped overseas in crates , and assembled on the completed pedestal on what was then called Bedloe 's Island . The statue 's completion was marked by New York 's first ticker - tape parade and a dedication ceremony presided over by President Grover Cleveland . </P> <P> The statue was administered by the United States Lighthouse Board until 1901 and then by the Department of War ; since 1933 it has been maintained by the National Park Service . Public access to the balcony around the torch has been barred for safety since 1916 . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Design and construction process <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Origin </Li> <Li> 1.2 Design , style , and symbolism </Li> <Li> 1.3 Announcement and early work </Li> <Li> 1.4 Construction in France <Ul> <Li> 1.4. 1 Design </Li> <Li> 1.4. 2 Fundraising </Li> <Li> 1.4. 3 Construction </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 1.5 Dedication </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 After dedication <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Lighthouse Board and War Department ( 1886 -- 1933 ) </Li> <Li> 2.2 Early National Park Service years ( 1933 -- 1982 ) </Li> <Li> 2.3 Renovation and rededication ( 1982 -- 2000 ) </Li> <Li> 2.4 Closures and reopenings ( 2001 -- present ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Access and attributes <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Location and tourism </Li> <Li> 3.2 Inscriptions , plaques , and dedications </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 UNESCO World Heritage Site <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Physical characteristics </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Depictions </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 References </Li> <Li> 8 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Design and construction process </H2> <H3> Origin </H3> <P> According to the National Park Service , the idea for the Statue of Liberty was first proposed by Édouard René de Laboulaye the president of the French Anti-Slavery Society and a prominent and important political thinker of his time . The project is traced to a mid-1865 conversation between de Laboulaye , a staunch abolitionist and Frédéric Bartholdi , a sculptor . In after - dinner conversation at his home near Versailles , Laboulaye , an ardent supporter of the Union in the American Civil War , is supposed to have said : `` If a monument should rise in the United States , as a memorial to their independence , I should think it only natural if it were built by united effort -- a common work of both our nations . '' The National Park Service , in a 2000 report , however , deemed this a legend traced to an 1885 fundraising pamphlet , and that the statue was most likely conceived in 1870 . In another essay on their website , the Park Service suggested that Laboulaye was minded to honor the Union victory and its consequences , `` With the abolition of slavery and the Union 's victory in the Civil War in 1865 , Laboulaye 's wishes of freedom and democracy were turning into a reality in the United States . In order to honor these achievements , Laboulaye proposed that a gift be built for the United States on behalf of France . Laboulaye hoped that by calling attention to the recent achievements of the United States , the French people would be inspired to call for their own democracy in the face of a repressive monarchy . '' </P> Bartholdi 's design patent <P> According to sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi , who later recounted the story , Laboulaye 's comment was not intended as a proposal , but it inspired Bartholdi . Given the repressive nature of the regime of Napoleon III , Bartholdi took no immediate action on the idea except to discuss it with Laboulaye . Bartholdi was in any event busy with other possible projects ; in the late 1860s , he approached Isma'il Pasha , Khedive of Egypt , a plan to build Progress or Egypt Carrying the Light to Asia , a huge lighthouse in the form of an ancient Egyptian female fellah or peasant , robed and holding a torch aloft , at the northern entrance to the Suez Canal in Port Said . Sketches and models were made of the proposed work , though it was never erected . There was a classical precedent for the Suez proposal , the Colossus of Rhodes : an ancient bronze statue of the Greek god of the sun , Helios . This statue is believed to have been over 100 feet ( 30 m ) high , and it similarly stood at a harbor entrance and carried a light to guide ships . </P> <P> Any large project was further delayed by the Franco - Prussian War , in which Bartholdi served as a major of militia . In the war , Napoleon III was captured and deposed . Bartholdi 's home province of Alsace was lost to the Prussians , and a more liberal republic was installed in France . As Bartholdi had been planning a trip to the United States , he and Laboulaye decided the time was right to discuss the idea with influential Americans . In June 1871 , Bartholdi crossed the Atlantic , with letters of introduction signed by Laboulaye . </P> <P> Arriving at New York Harbor , Bartholdi focused on Bedloe 's Island ( now named Liberty Island ) as a site for the statue , struck by the fact that vessels arriving in New York had to sail past it . He was delighted to learn that the island was owned by the United States government -- it had been ceded by the New York State Legislature in 1800 for harbor defense . It was thus , as he put it in a letter to Laboulaye : `` land common to all the states . '' As well as meeting many influential New Yorkers , Bartholdi visited President Ulysses S. Grant , who assured him that it would not be difficult to obtain the site for the statue . Bartholdi crossed the United States twice by rail , and met many Americans who he thought would be sympathetic to the project . But he remained concerned that popular opinion on both sides of the Atlantic was insufficiently supportive of the proposal , and he and Laboulaye decided to wait before mounting a public campaign . </P> Bartholdi 's Lion of Belfort <P> Bartholdi had made a first model of his concept in 1870 . The son of a friend of Bartholdi 's , American artist John LaFarge , later maintained that Bartholdi made the first sketches for the statue during his U.S. visit at La Farge 's Rhode Island studio . Bartholdi continued to develop the concept following his return to France . He also worked on a number of sculptures designed to bolster French patriotism after the defeat by the Prussians . One of these was the Lion of Belfort , a monumental sculpture carved in sandstone below the fortress of Belfort , which during the war had resisted a Prussian siege for over three months . The defiant lion , 73 feet ( 22 m ) long and half that in height , displays an emotional quality characteristic of Romanticism , which Bartholdi would later bring to the Statue of Liberty . </P> <H3> Design , style , and symbolism </H3> Detail from a fresco by Constantino Brumidi in the U.S. Capitol in Washington , D.C. , showing two early symbols of America : Columbia ( left ) and the Indian princess <P> Bartholdi and Laboulaye considered how best to express the idea of American liberty . In early American history , two female figures were frequently used as cultural symbols of the nation . One of these symbols , the personified Columbia , was seen as an embodiment of the United States in the manner that Britannia was identified with the United Kingdom and Marianne came to represent France . Columbia had supplanted the earlier figure of an Indian princess , which had come to be regarded as uncivilized and derogatory toward Americans . The other significant female icon in American culture was a representation of Liberty , derived from Libertas , the goddess of freedom widely worshipped in ancient Rome , especially among emancipated slaves . A Liberty figure adorned most American coins of the time , and representations of Liberty appeared in popular and civic art , including Thomas Crawford 's Statue of Freedom ( 1863 ) atop the dome of the United States Capitol Building . </P> <P> Artists of the 18th and 19th centuries striving to evoke republican ideals commonly used representations of Libertas as an allegorical symbol . A figure of Liberty was also depicted on the Great Seal of France . However , Bartholdi and Laboulaye avoided an image of revolutionary liberty such as that depicted in Eugène Delacroix 's famed Liberty Leading the People ( 1830 ) . In this painting , which commemorates France 's Revolution of 1830 , a half - clothed Liberty leads an armed mob over the bodies of the fallen . Laboulaye had no sympathy for revolution , and so Bartholdi 's figure would be fully dressed in flowing robes . Instead of the impression of violence in the Delacroix work , Bartholdi wished to give the statue a peaceful appearance and chose a torch , representing progress , for the figure to hold . </P> <P> Crawford 's statue was designed in the early 1850s . It was originally to be crowned with a pileus , the cap given to emancipated slaves in ancient Rome . Secretary of War Jefferson Davis , a Southerner who would later serve as President of the Confederate States of America , was concerned that the pileus would be taken as an abolitionist symbol . He ordered that it be changed to a helmet . Delacroix 's figure wears a pileus , and Bartholdi at first considered placing one on his figure as well . Instead , he used a diadem , or crown , to top its head . In so doing , he avoided a reference to Marianne , who invariably wears a pileus . The seven rays form a halo or aureole . They evoke the sun , the seven seas , and the seven continents , and represent another means , besides the torch , whereby Liberty enlightens the world . </P> <P> Bartholdi 's early models were all similar in concept : a female figure in neoclassical style representing liberty , wearing a stola and pella ( gown and cloak , common in depictions of Roman goddesses ) and holding a torch aloft . According to popular accounts , the face was modeled after that of Charlotte Beysser Bartholdi , the sculptor 's mother , but Regis Huber , the curator of the Bartholdi Museum is on record as saying that this , as well as other similar speculations , have no basis in fact . He designed the figure with a strong , uncomplicated silhouette , which would be set off well by its dramatic harbor placement and allow passengers on vessels entering New York Bay to experience a changing perspective on the statue as they proceeded toward Manhattan . He gave it bold classical contours and applied simplified modeling , reflecting the huge scale of the project and its solemn purpose . Bartholdi wrote of his technique : </P> Thomas Crawford 's Statue of Freedom <P> The surfaces should be broad and simple , defined by a bold and clear design , accentuated in the important places . The enlargement of the details or their multiplicity is to be feared . By exaggerating the forms , in order to render them more clearly visible , or by enriching them with details , we would destroy the proportion of the work . Finally , the model , like the design , should have a summarized character , such as one would give to a rapid sketch . Only it is necessary that this character should be the product of volition and study , and that the artist , concentrating his knowledge , should find the form and the line in its greatest simplicity . </P> <P> Bartholdi made alterations in the design as the project evolved . Bartholdi considered having Liberty hold a broken chain , but decided this would be too divisive in the days after the Civil War . The erected statue does rise over a broken chain , half - hidden by her robes and difficult to see from the ground . Bartholdi was initially uncertain of what to place in Liberty 's left hand ; he settled on a tabula ansata , used to evoke the concept of law . Though Bartholdi greatly admired the United States Constitution , he chose to inscribe `` JULY IV MDCCLXXVI '' on the tablet , thus associating the date of the country 's Declaration of Independence with the concept of liberty . </P> <P> Bartholdi interested his friend and mentor , architect Eugène Viollet - le - Duc , in the project . As chief engineer , Viollet - le - Duc designed a brick pier within the statue , to which the skin would be anchored . After consultations with the metalwork foundry Gaget , Gauthier & Co. , Viollet - le - Duc chose the metal which would be used for the skin , copper sheets , and the method used to shape it , repoussé , in which the sheets were heated and then struck with wooden hammers . An advantage of this choice was that the entire statue would be light for its volume , as the copper need be only 0.094 inches ( 2.4 mm ) thick . Bartholdi had decided on a height of just over 151 feet ( 46 m ) for the statue , double that of Italy 's Sancarlone and the German statue of Arminius , both made with the same method . </P> <H3> Announcement and early work </H3> <P> By 1875 , France was enjoying improved political stability and a recovering postwar economy . Growing interest in the upcoming Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia led Laboulaye to decide it was time to seek public support . In September 1875 , he announced the project and the formation of the Franco - American Union as its fundraising arm . With the announcement , the statue was given a name , Liberty Enlightening the World . The French would finance the statue ; Americans would be expected to pay for the pedestal . The announcement provoked a generally favorable reaction in France , though many Frenchmen resented the United States for not coming to their aid during the war with Prussia . French monarchists opposed the statue , if for no other reason than it was proposed by the liberal Laboulaye , who had recently been elected a senator for life . Laboulaye arranged events designed to appeal to the rich and powerful , including a special performance at the Paris Opera on April 25 , 1876 , that featured a new cantata by composer Charles Gounod . The piece was titled La Liberté éclairant le monde , the French version of the statue 's announced name . </P> Stereoscopic image of right arm and torch of the Statue of Liberty , 1876 Centennial Exposition <P> Despite its initial focus on the elites , the Union was successful in raising funds from across French society . Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave , as did 181 French municipalities . Laboulaye 's political allies supported the call , as did descendants of the French contingent in the American Revolutionary War . Less idealistically , contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the Panama Canal . The copper may have come from multiple sources and some of it is said to have come from a mine in Visnes , Norway , though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples . According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the Museum of the City of New York , 90,800 kilos ( 200,000 pounds ) was needed to build the statue , and the French copper industrialist Eugène Secrétan donated 58,100 kilos ( 128,000 pounds ) of copper . </P> <P> Although plans for the statue had not been finalized , Bartholdi moved forward with fabrication of the right arm , bearing the torch , and the head . Work began at the Gaget , Gauthier & Co. workshop . In May 1876 , Bartholdi traveled to the United States as a member of a French delegation to the Centennial Exhibition , and arranged for a huge painting of the statue to be shown in New York as part of the Centennial festivities . The arm did not arrive in Philadelphia until August ; because of its late arrival , it was not listed in the exhibition catalogue , and while some reports correctly identified the work , others called it the `` Colossal Arm '' or `` Bartholdi Electric Light '' . The exhibition grounds contained a number of monumental artworks to compete for fairgoers ' interest , including an outsized fountain designed by Bartholdi . Nevertheless , the arm proved popular in the exhibition 's waning days , and visitors would climb up to the balcony of the torch to view the fairgrounds . After the exhibition closed , the arm was transported to New York , where it remained on display in Madison Square Park for several years before it was returned to France to join the rest of the statue . </P> <P> During his second trip to the United States , Bartholdi addressed a number of groups about the project , and urged the formation of American committees of the Franco - American Union . Committees to raise money to pay for the foundation and pedestal were formed in New York , Boston , and Philadelphia . The New York group eventually took on most of the responsibility for American fundraising and is often referred to as the `` American Committee '' . One of its members was 19 - year - old Theodore Roosevelt , the future governor of New York and president of the United States . On March 3 , 1877 , on his final full day in office , President Grant signed a joint resolution that authorized the President to accept the statue when it was presented by France and to select a site for it . President Rutherford B. Hayes , who took office the following day , selected the Bedloe 's Island site that Bartholdi had proposed . </P> <H3> Construction in France </H3> The statue 's head on exhibit at the Paris World 's Fair , 1878 <P> On his return to Paris in 1877 , Bartholdi concentrated on completing the head , which was exhibited at the 1878 Paris World 's Fair . Fundraising continued , with models of the statue put on sale . Tickets to view the construction activity at the Gaget , Gauthier & Co. workshop were also offered . The French government authorized a lottery ; among the prizes were valuable silver plate and a terracotta model of the statue . By the end of 1879 , about 250,000 francs had been raised . </P> <P> The head and arm had been built with assistance from Viollet - le - Duc , who fell ill in 1879 . He soon died , leaving no indication of how he intended to transition from the copper skin to his proposed masonry pier . The following year , Bartholdi was able to obtain the services of the innovative designer and builder Gustave Eiffel . Eiffel and his structural engineer , Maurice Koechlin , decided to abandon the pier and instead build an iron truss tower . Eiffel opted not to use a completely rigid structure , which would force stresses to accumulate in the skin and lead eventually to cracking . A secondary skeleton was attached to the center pylon , then , to enable the statue to move slightly in the winds of New York Harbor and as the metal expanded on hot summer days , he loosely connected the support structure to the skin using flat iron bars which culminated in a mesh of metal straps , known as `` saddles '' , that were riveted to the skin , providing firm support . In a labor - intensive process , each saddle had to be crafted individually . To prevent galvanic corrosion between the copper skin and the iron support structure , Eiffel insulated the skin with asbestos impregnated with shellac . </P> <P> Eiffel 's design made the statue one of the earliest examples of curtain wall construction , in which the exterior of the structure is not load bearing , but is instead supported by an interior framework . He included two interior spiral staircases , to make it easier for visitors to reach the observation point in the crown . Access to an observation platform surrounding the torch was also provided , but the narrowness of the arm allowed for only a single ladder , 40 feet ( 12 m ) long . As the pylon tower arose , Eiffel and Bartholdi coordinated their work carefully so that completed segments of skin would fit exactly on the support structure . The components of the pylon tower were built in the Eiffel factory in the nearby Parisian suburb of Levallois - Perret . </P> <P> The change in structural material from masonry to iron allowed Bartholdi to change his plans for the statue 's assembly . He had originally expected to assemble the skin on - site as the masonry pier was built ; instead he decided to build the statue in France and have it disassembled and transported to the United States for reassembly in place on Bedloe 's Island . </P> <P> In a symbolic act , the first rivet placed into the skin , fixing a copper plate onto the statue 's big toe , was driven by United States Ambassador to France Levi P. Morton . The skin was not , however , crafted in exact sequence from low to high ; work proceeded on a number of segments simultaneously in a manner often confusing to visitors . Some work was performed by contractors -- one of the fingers was made to Bartholdi 's exacting specifications by a coppersmith in the southern French town of Montauban . By 1882 , the statue was complete up to the waist , an event Barthodi celebrated by inviting reporters to lunch on a platform built within the statue . Laboulaye died in 1883 . He was succeeded as chairman of the French committee by Ferdinand de Lesseps , builder of the Suez Canal . The completed statue was formally presented to Ambassador Morton at a ceremony in Paris on July 4 , 1884 , and de Lesseps announced that the French government had agreed to pay for its transport to New York . The statue remained intact in Paris pending sufficient progress on the pedestal ; by January 1885 , this had occurred and the statue was disassembled and crated for its ocean voyage . </P> Richard Morris Hunt 's pedestal under construction in June 1885 <P> The committees in the United States faced great difficulties in obtaining funds for the construction of the pedestal . The Panic of 1873 had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade . The Liberty statue project was not the only such undertaking that had difficulty raising money : construction of the obelisk later known as the Washington Monument sometimes stalled for years ; it would ultimately take over three - and - a-half decades to complete . There was criticism both of Bartholdi 's statue and of the fact that the gift required Americans to foot the bill for the pedestal . In the years following the Civil War , most Americans preferred realistic artworks depicting heroes and events from the nation 's history , rather than allegorical works like the Liberty statue . There was also a feeling that Americans should design American public works -- the selection of Italian - born Constantino Brumidi to decorate the Capitol had provoked intense criticism , even though he was a naturalized U.S. citizen . Harper 's Weekly declared its wish that `` M. Bartholdi and our French cousins had ' gone the whole figure ' while they were about it , and given us statue and pedestal at once . '' The New York Times stated that `` no true patriot can countenance any such expenditures for bronze females in the present state of our finances . '' Faced with these criticisms , the American committees took little action for several years . </P> Design Frank Leslie 's Illustrated Newspaper , June 1885 , showing ( clockwise from left ) woodcuts of the completed statue in Paris , Bartholdi , and the statue 's interior structure <P> The foundation of Bartholdi 's statue was to be laid inside Fort Wood , a disused army base on Bedloe 's Island constructed between 1807 and 1811 . Since 1823 , it had rarely been used , though during the Civil War , it had served as a recruiting station . The fortifications of the structure were in the shape of an eleven - point star . The statue 's foundation and pedestal were aligned so that it would face southeast , greeting ships entering the harbor from the Atlantic Ocean . In 1881 , the New York committee commissioned Richard Morris Hunt to design the pedestal . Within months , Hunt submitted a detailed plan , indicating that he expected construction to take about nine months . He proposed a pedestal 114 feet ( 35 m ) in height ; faced with money problems , the committee reduced that to 89 feet ( 27 m ) . </P> <P> Hunt 's pedestal design contains elements of classical architecture , including Doric portals , as well as some elements influenced by Aztec architecture . The large mass is fragmented with architectural detail , in order to focus attention on the statue . In form , it is a truncated pyramid , 62 feet ( 19 m ) square at the base and 39.4 feet ( 12.0 m ) at the top . The four sides are identical in appearance . Above the door on each side , there are ten disks upon which Bartholdi proposed to place the coats of arms of the states ( between 1876 and 1889 , there were 38 U.S. states ) , although this was not done . Above that , a balcony was placed on each side , framed by pillars . Bartholdi placed an observation platform near the top of the pedestal , above which the statue itself rises . According to author Louis Auchincloss , the pedestal `` craggily evokes the power of an ancient Europe over which rises the dominating figure of the Statue of Liberty '' . The committee hired former army General Charles Pomeroy Stone to oversee the construction work . Construction on the 15 - foot - deep ( 4.6 m ) foundation began in 1883 , and the pedestal 's cornerstone was laid in 1884 . In Hunt 's original conception , the pedestal was to have been made of solid granite . Financial concerns again forced him to revise his plans ; the final design called for poured concrete walls , up to 20 feet ( 6.1 m ) thick , faced with granite blocks . This Stony Creek granite came from the Beattie Quarry in Branford , Connecticut . The concrete mass was the largest poured to that time . </P> <P> Norwegian immigrant civil engineer Joachim Goschen Giæver designed the structural framework for the Statue of Liberty . His work involved design computations , detailed fabrication and construction drawings , and oversight of construction . In completing his engineering for the statue 's frame , Giæver worked from drawings and sketches produced by Gustave Eiffel . </P> Fundraising Unpacking of the face of the Statue of Liberty , which was delivered on June 17 , 1885 <P> Fundraising for the statue had begun in 1882 . The committee organized a large number of money - raising events . As part of one such effort , an auction of art and manuscripts , poet Emma Lazarus was asked to donate an original work . She initially declined , stating she could not write a poem about a statue . At the time , she was also involved in aiding refugees to New York who had fled anti-Semitic pogroms in eastern Europe . These refugees were forced to live in conditions that the wealthy Lazarus had never experienced . She saw a way to express her empathy for these refugees in terms of the statue . The resulting sonnet , `` The New Colossus '' , including the iconic lines `` Give me your tired , your poor / Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free '' , is uniquely identified with the Statue of Liberty and is inscribed on a plaque in the museum in its base . </P> <P> Even with these efforts , fundraising lagged . Grover Cleveland , the governor of New York , vetoed a bill to provide $50,000 for the statue project in 1884 . An attempt the next year to have Congress provide $100,000 , sufficient to complete the project , also failed . The New York committee , with only $3,000 in the bank , suspended work on the pedestal . With the project in jeopardy , groups from other American cities , including Boston and Philadelphia , offered to pay the full cost of erecting the statue in return for relocating it . </P> <P> Joseph Pulitzer , publisher of the New York World , a New York newspaper , announced a drive to raise $100,000 -- the equivalent of $2.3 million today . Pulitzer pledged to print the name of every contributor , no matter how small the amount given . The drive captured the imagination of New Yorkers , especially when Pulitzer began publishing the notes he received from contributors . `` A young girl alone in the world '' donated `` 60 cents , the result of self denial . '' One donor gave `` five cents as a poor office boy 's mite toward the Pedestal Fund . '' A group of children sent a dollar as `` the money we saved to go to the circus with . '' Another dollar was given by a `` lonely and very aged woman . '' Residents of a home for alcoholics in New York 's rival city of Brooklyn -- the cities would not merge until 1898 -- donated $15 ; other drinkers helped out through donation boxes in bars and saloons . A kindergarten class in Davenport , Iowa , mailed the World a gift of $1.35 . As the donations flooded in , the committee resumed work on the pedestal . </P> Construction <P> On June 17 , 1885 , the French steamer Isère , laden with the Statue of Liberty , reached the New York port safely . New Yorkers displayed their new - found enthusiasm for the statue , as the French vessel arrived with the crates holding the disassembled statue on board . Two hundred thousand people lined the docks and hundreds of boats put to sea to welcome the Isère . After five months of daily calls to donate to the statue fund , on August 11 , 1885 , the World announced that $102,000 had been raised from 120,000 donors , and that 80 percent of the total had been received in sums of less than one dollar . </P> <P> Even with the success of the fund drive , the pedestal was not completed until April 1886 . Immediately thereafter , reassembly of the statue began . Eiffel 's iron framework was anchored to steel I - beams within the concrete pedestal and assembled . Once this was done , the sections of skin were carefully attached . Due to the width of the pedestal , it was not possible to erect scaffolding , and workers dangled from ropes while installing the skin sections . Nevertheless , no one died during the construction . Bartholdi had planned to put floodlights on the torch 's balcony to illuminate it ; a week before the dedication , the Army Corps of Engineers vetoed the proposal , fearing that ships ' pilots passing the statue would be blinded . Instead , Bartholdi cut portholes in the torch -- which was covered with gold leaf -- and placed the lights inside them . A power plant was installed on the island to light the torch and for other electrical needs . After the skin was completed , renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted , co-designer of New York 's Central Park and Brooklyn 's Prospect Park , supervised a cleanup of Bedloe 's Island in anticipation of the dedication . </P> <H3> Dedication </H3> Unveiling of the Statue of Liberty Enlightening the World ( 1886 ) by Edward Moran . Oil on canvas . The J. Clarence Davies Collection , Museum of the City of New York . <P> A ceremony of dedication was held on the afternoon of October 28 , 1886 . President Grover Cleveland , the former New York governor , presided over the event . On the morning of the dedication , a parade was held in New York City ; estimates of the number of people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million . President Cleveland headed the procession , then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America . General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade . The route began at Madison Square , once the venue for the arm , and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway , with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row . As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange , traders threw ticker tape from the windows , beginning the New York tradition of the ticker - tape parade . </P> <P> A nautical parade began at 12 : 45 p.m. , and President Cleveland embarked on a yacht that took him across the harbor to Bedloe 's Island for the dedication . De Lesseps made the first speech , on behalf of the French committee , followed by the chairman of the New York committee , Senator William M. Evarts . A French flag draped across the statue 's face was to be lowered to unveil the statue at the close of Evarts 's speech , but Bartholdi mistook a pause as the conclusion and let the flag fall prematurely . The ensuing cheers put an end to Evarts 's address . President Cleveland spoke next , stating that the statue 's `` stream of light shall pierce the darkness of ignorance and man 's oppression until Liberty enlightens the world '' . Bartholdi , observed near the dais , was called upon to speak , but he declined . Orator Chauncey M. Depew concluded the speechmaking with a lengthy address . </P> <P> No members of the general public were permitted on the island during the ceremonies , which were reserved entirely for dignitaries . The only females granted access were Bartholdi 's wife and de Lesseps 's granddaughter ; officials stated that they feared women might be injured in the crush of people . The restriction offended area suffragists , who chartered a boat and got as close as they could to the island . The group 's leaders made speeches applauding the embodiment of Liberty as a woman and advocating women 's right to vote . A scheduled fireworks display was postponed until November 1 because of poor weather . </P> <P> Shortly after the dedication , The Cleveland Gazette , an African American newspaper , suggested that the statue 's torch not be lit until the United States became a free nation `` in reality '' : </P> <P> `` Liberty enlightening the world , '' indeed ! The expression makes us sick . This government is a howling farce . It can not or rather does not protect its citizens within its own borders . Shove the Bartholdi statue , torch and all , into the ocean until the `` liberty '' of this country is such as to make it possible for an inoffensive and industrious colored man to earn a respectable living for himself and family , without being ku - kluxed , perhaps murdered , his daughter and wife outraged , and his property destroyed . The idea of the `` liberty '' of this country `` enlightening the world , '' or even Patagonia , is ridiculous in the extreme . </P> <H2> After dedication </H2> <H3> Lighthouse Board and War Department ( 1886 -- 1933 ) </H3> Statue of Liberty ca . 1900 Government poster using the Statue of Liberty to promote the sale of Liberty Bonds <P> When the torch was illuminated on the evening of the statue 's dedication , it produced only a faint gleam , barely visible from Manhattan . The World characterized it as `` more like a glowworm than a beacon . '' Bartholdi suggested gilding the statue to increase its ability to reflect light , but this proved too expensive . The United States Lighthouse Board took over the Statue of Liberty in 1887 and pledged to install equipment to enhance the torch 's effect ; in spite of its efforts , the statue remained virtually invisible at night . When Bartholdi returned to the United States in 1893 , he made additional suggestions , all of which proved ineffective . He did successfully lobby for improved lighting within the statue , allowing visitors to better appreciate Eiffel 's design . In 1901 , President Theodore Roosevelt , once a member of the New York committee , ordered the statue 's transfer to the War Department , as it had proved useless as a lighthouse . A unit of the Army Signal Corps was stationed on Bedloe 's Island until 1923 , after which military police remained there while the island was under military jurisdiction . </P> <P> The statue rapidly became a landmark . Many immigrants who entered through New York saw it as a welcoming sight . Oral histories of immigrants record their feelings of exhilaration on first viewing the Statue of Liberty . One immigrant who arrived from Greece recalled , </P> <P> I saw the Statue of Liberty . And I said to myself , `` Lady , you 're such a beautiful ! ( sic ) You opened your arms and you get all the foreigners here . Give me a chance to prove that I am worth it , to do something , to be someone in America . '' And always that statue was on my mind . </P> <P> Originally , the statue was a dull copper color , but shortly after 1900 a green patina , also called verdigris , caused by the oxidation of the copper skin , began to spread . As early as 1902 it was mentioned in the press ; by 1906 it had entirely covered the statue . Believing that the patina was evidence of corrosion , Congress authorized US $62,800 ( equivalent to $1,673,969 in 2016 ) for various repairs , and to paint the statue both inside and out . There was considerable public protest against the proposed exterior painting . The Army Corps of Engineers studied the patina for any ill effects to the statue and concluded that it protected the skin , `` softened the outlines of the Statue and made it beautiful . '' The statue was painted only on the inside . The Corps of Engineers also installed an elevator to take visitors from the base to the top of the pedestal . </P> <P> On July 30 , 1916 , during World War I , German saboteurs set off a disastrous explosion on the Black Tom peninsula in Jersey City , New Jersey , in what is now part of Liberty State Park , close to Bedloe 's Island . Carloads of dynamite and other explosives that were being sent to Britain and France for their war efforts were detonated , and seven people were killed . The statue sustained minor damage , mostly to the torch - bearing right arm , and was closed for ten days . The cost to repair the statue and buildings on the island was about US $100,000 ( equivalent to $2,200,917 in 2016 ) . The narrow ascent to the torch was closed for public - safety reasons , and it has remained closed ever since . </P> <P> That same year , Ralph Pulitzer , who had succeeded his father Joseph as publisher of the World , began a drive to raise US $30,000 ( equivalent to $660,275 in 2016 ) for an exterior lighting system to illuminate the statue at night . He claimed over 80,000 contributors , but failed to reach the goal . The difference was quietly made up by a gift from a wealthy donor -- a fact that was not revealed until 1936 . An underwater power cable brought electricity from the mainland and floodlights were placed along the walls of Fort Wood . Gutzon Borglum , who later sculpted Mount Rushmore , redesigned the torch , replacing much of the original copper with stained glass . On December 2 , 1916 , President Woodrow Wilson pressed the telegraph key that turned on the lights , successfully illuminating the statue . </P> <P> After the United States entered World War I in 1917 , images of the statue were heavily used in both recruitment posters and the Liberty Bond drives that urged American citizens to support the war financially . This impressed upon the public the war 's stated purpose -- to secure liberty -- and served as a reminder that embattled France had given the United States the statue . </P> <P> In 1924 , President Calvin Coolidge used his authority under the Antiquities Act to declare the statue a National Monument . The only successful suicide in the statue 's history occurred five years later , when a man climbed out of one of the windows in the crown and jumped to his death , glancing off the statue 's breast and landing on the base . </P> <H3> Early National Park Service years ( 1933 -- 1982 ) </H3> Bedloe 's Island in 1927 , showing the statue and army buildings . The eleven - pointed walls of Fort Wood , which still form the statue 's base , are visible . <P> In 1933 , President Franklin Roosevelt ordered the statue to be transferred to the National Park Service ( NPS ) . In 1937 , the NPS gained jurisdiction over the rest of Bedloe 's Island . With the Army 's departure , the NPS began to transform the island into a park . The Works Progress Administration ( WPA ) demolished most of the old buildings , regraded and reseeded the eastern end of the island , and built granite steps for a new public entrance to the statue from its rear . The WPA also carried out restoration work within the statue , temporarily removing the rays from the statue 's halo so their rusted supports could be replaced . Rusted cast - iron steps in the pedestal were replaced with new ones made of reinforced concrete ; the upper parts of the stairways within the statue were replaced , as well . Copper sheathing was installed to prevent further damage from rainwater that had been seeping into the pedestal . The statue was closed to the public from May until December 1938 . </P> <P> During World War II , the statue remained open to visitors , although it was not illuminated at night due to wartime blackouts . It was lit briefly on December 31 , 1943 , and on D - Day , June 6 , 1944 , when its lights flashed `` dot - dot - dot - dash '' , the Morse code for V , for victory . New , powerful lighting was installed in 1944 -- 1945 , and beginning on V-E Day , the statue was once again illuminated after sunset . The lighting was for only a few hours each evening , and it was not until 1957 that the statue was illuminated every night , all night . In 1946 , the interior of the statue within reach of visitors was coated with a special plastic so that graffiti could be washed away . </P> <P> In 1956 , an Act of Congress officially renamed Bedloe 's Island as Liberty Island , a change advocated by Bartholdi generations earlier . The act also mentioned the efforts to found an American Museum of Immigration on the island , which backers took as federal approval of the project , though the government was slow to grant funds for it . Nearby Ellis Island was made part of the Statue of Liberty National Monument by proclamation of President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 . In 1972 , the immigration museum , in the statue 's base , was finally opened in a ceremony led by President Richard Nixon . The museum 's backers never provided it with an endowment to secure its future and it closed in 1991 after the opening of an immigration museum on Ellis Island . </P> September 26 , 1972 : President Richard Nixon visits the statue to open the American Museum of Immigration . The statue 's raised right foot is visible , showing that it is depicted moving forward . <P> In 1970 , Ivy Bottini led a demonstration at the statue where she and others from the National Organization for Women 's New York chapter draped an enormous banner over a railing which read `` WOMEN OF THE WORLD UNITE ! '' </P> <P> Beginning December 26 , 1971 , 15 anti-Vietnam War veterans occupied the statue , flying a US flag upside down from her crown . They left December 28 following a Federal Court order . The statue was also several times taken over briefly by demonstrators publicizing causes such as Puerto Rican independence , opposition to abortion , and opposition to US intervention in Grenada . Demonstrations with the permission of the Park Service included a Gay Pride Parade rally and the annual Captive Baltic Nations rally . </P> <P> A powerful new lighting system was installed in advance of the American Bicentennial in 1976 . The statue was the focal point for Operation Sail , a regatta of tall ships from all over the world that entered New York Harbor on July 4 , 1976 , and sailed around Liberty Island . The day concluded with a spectacular display of fireworks near the statue . </P> <H3> Renovation and rededication ( 1982 -- 2000 ) </H3> July 4 , 1986 : First Lady Nancy Reagan ( in red ) reopens the statue to the public . Main article : Conservation - restoration of the Statue of Liberty See also : Liberty Weekend <P> The statue was examined in great detail by French and American engineers as part of the planning for its centennial in 1986 . In 1982 , it was announced that the statue was in need of considerable restoration . Careful study had revealed that the right arm had been improperly attached to the main structure . It was swaying more and more when strong winds blew and there was a significant risk of structural failure . In addition , the head had been installed 2 feet ( 0.61 m ) off center , and one of the rays was wearing a hole in the right arm when the statue moved in the wind . The armature structure was badly corroded , and about two percent of the exterior plates needed to be replaced . Although problems with the armature had been recognized as early as 1936 , when cast iron replacements for some of the bars had been installed , much of the corrosion had been hidden by layers of paint applied over the years . </P> <P> In May 1982 , President Ronald Reagan announced the formation of the Statue of Liberty -- Ellis Island Centennial Commission , led by Chrysler Corporation chair Lee Iacocca , to raise the funds needed to complete the work . Through its fundraising arm , the Statue of Liberty -- Ellis Island Foundation , Inc. , the group raised more than $350 million in donations . The Statue of Liberty was one of the earliest beneficiaries of a cause marketing campaign . A 1983 promotion advertised that for each purchase made with an American Express card , the company would contribute one cent to the renovation of the statue . The campaign generated contributions of $1.7 million to the restoration project . </P> <P> In 1984 , the statue was closed to the public for the duration of the renovation . Workers erected the world 's largest free - standing scaffold , which obscured the statue from view . Liquid nitrogen was used to remove layers of paint that had been applied to the interior of the copper skin over decades , leaving two layers of coal tar , originally applied to plug leaks and prevent corrosion . Blasting with baking soda powder removed the tar without further damaging the copper . The restorers ' work was hampered by the asbestos - based substance that Bartholdi had used -- ineffectively , as inspections showed -- to prevent galvanic corrosion . Workers within the statue had to wear protective gear , dubbed `` moon suits '' , with self - contained breathing circuits . Larger holes in the copper skin were repaired , and new copper was added where necessary . The replacement skin was taken from a copper rooftop at Bell Labs , which had a patina that closely resembled the statue 's ; in exchange , the laboratory was provided some of the old copper skin for testing . The torch , found to have been leaking water since the 1916 alterations , was replaced with an exact replica of Bartholdi 's unaltered torch . Consideration was given to replacing the arm and shoulder ; the National Park Service insisted that they be repaired instead . The original torch was removed and replaced in 1986 with the current one , whose flame is covered in 24 - carat gold . The torch reflects the sun 's rays in daytime and is lighted by floodlights at night . </P> Liberty Enlightening the World <P> The entire puddled iron armature designed by Gustave Eiffel was replaced . Low - carbon corrosion - resistant stainless steel bars that now hold the staples next to the skin are made of Ferralium , an alloy that bends slightly and returns to its original shape as the statue moves . To prevent the ray and arm making contact , the ray was realigned by several degrees . The lighting was again replaced -- night - time illumination subsequently came from metal - halide lamps that send beams of light to particular parts of the pedestal or statue , showing off various details . Access to the pedestal , which had been through a nondescript entrance built in the 1960s , was renovated to create a wide opening framed by a set of monumental bronze doors with designs symbolic of the renovation . A modern elevator was installed , allowing handicapped access to the observation area of the pedestal . An emergency elevator was installed within the statue , reaching up to the level of the shoulder . </P> <P> July 3 -- 6 , 1986 , was designated `` Liberty Weekend '' , marking the centennial of the statue and its reopening . President Reagan presided over the rededication , with French President François Mitterrand in attendance . July 4 saw a reprise of Operation Sail , and the statue was reopened to the public on July 5 . In Reagan 's dedication speech , he stated , `` We are the keepers of the flame of liberty ; we hold it high for the world to see . '' </P> <H3> Closures and reopenings ( 2001 -- present ) </H3> The Statue of Liberty on September 11 , 2001 as the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center burn in the background <P> Following the September 11 attacks , the statue and Liberty Island were immediately closed to the public . The island reopened at the end of 2001 , while the pedestal and statue remained off - limits . The pedestal reopened in August 2004 , but the National Park Service announced that visitors could not safely be given access to the statue due to the difficulty of evacuation in an emergency . The Park Service adhered to that position through the remainder of the Bush administration . New York Congressman Anthony Weiner made the statue 's reopening a personal crusade . On May 17 , 2009 , President Barack Obama 's Secretary of the Interior , Ken Salazar , announced that as a `` special gift '' to America , the statue would be reopened to the public as of July 4 , but that only a limited number of people would be permitted to ascend to the crown each day . </P> <P> The statue , including the pedestal and base , closed on October 29 , 2011 , for installation of new elevators and staircases and to bring other facilities , such as restrooms , up to code . The statue was reopened on October 28 , 2012 , only to close again a day later due to Hurricane Sandy . Although the storm did not harm the statue , it destroyed some of the infrastructure on both Liberty Island and Ellis Island , severely damaging the dock used by the ferries bearing visitors to the statue . On November 8 , 2012 , a Park Service spokesperson announced that both islands would remain closed for an indefinite period for repairs to be done . Due to lack of electricity on Liberty Island , a generator was installed to power temporary floodlights to illuminate the statue at night . The superintendent of Statue of Liberty National Monument , David Luchsinger , whose home on the island was severely damaged , stated that it would be `` optimistically ... months '' before the island was reopened to the public . The statue and Liberty Island reopened to the public on July 4 , 2013 . Ellis Island remained closed for repairs for several more months but reopened in late October 2013 . For part of October 2013 , Liberty Island was closed to the public due to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013 , along with other federally funded museums , parks , monuments , construction projects and buildings . </P> <P> On October 7 , 2016 , construction started on a new Statue of Liberty museum on Liberty Island . The new $70 million , 26,000 - square - foot ( 2,400 m ) museum will be able to accommodate all of the island 's visitors when it opens in 2019 , as opposed to the current museum , which only 20 % of the island 's visitors can visit . The original torch will be relocated here , and in addition to exhibits relating to the statue 's construction and history , there will be a theater where visitors can watch an aerial view of the statue . The museum , designed by FXFOWLE Architects , will integrate with the parkland around it . It is being funded privately by Diane von Fürstenberg , Michael Bloomberg , Jeff Bezos , Coca - Cola , NBCUniversal , the family of Laurence Tisch and Preston Robert Tisch , Mellody Hobson , and George Lucas . Von Fürstenberg heads the fundraising for the museum , and the project had garnered more than $40 million in fundraising as of groundbreaking . </P> <H2> Access and attributes </H2> <H3> Location and tourism </H3> Tourists aboard a Circle Line ferry arriving at Liberty Island , June 1973 <P> The statue is situated in Upper New York Bay on Liberty Island south of Ellis Island , which together comprise the Statue of Liberty National Monument . Both islands were ceded by New York to the federal government in 1800 . As agreed in an 1834 compact between New York and New Jersey that set the state border at the bay 's midpoint , the original islands remain New York territory despite their location on the New Jersey side of the state line . Liberty Island is one of the islands that are part of the borough of Manhattan in New York . Land created by reclamation added to the 2.3 acres ( 0.93 ha ) original island at Ellis Island is New Jersey territory . </P> <P> No charge is made for entrance to the national monument , but there is a cost for the ferry service that all visitors must use , as private boats may not dock at the island . A concession was granted in 2007 to Statue Cruises to operate the transportation and ticketing facilities , replacing Circle Line , which had operated the service since 1953 . The ferries , which depart from Liberty State Park in Jersey City and Battery Park in Lower Manhattan , also stop at Ellis Island when it is open to the public , making a combined trip possible . All ferry riders are subject to security screening , similar to airport procedures , prior to boarding . Visitors intending to enter the statue 's base and pedestal must obtain a complimentary museum / pedestal ticket along with their ferry ticket . Those wishing to climb the staircase within the statue to the crown purchase a special ticket , which may be reserved up to a year in advance . A total of 240 people per day are permitted to ascend : ten per group , three groups per hour . Climbers may bring only medication and cameras -- lockers are provided for other items -- and must undergo a second security screening . </P> <H3> Inscriptions , plaques , and dedications </H3> The Statue of Liberty stands on Liberty Island . <P> There are several plaques and dedicatory tablets on or near the Statue of Liberty . </P> <Ul> <Li> A plaque on the copper just under the figure in front declares that it is a colossal statue representing Liberty , designed by Bartholdi and built by the Paris firm of Gaget , Gauthier et Cie ( Cie is the French abbreviation analogous to Co . ) . </Li> <Li> A presentation tablet , also bearing Bartholdi 's name , declares the statue is a gift from the people of the Republic of France that honors `` the Alliance of the two Nations in achieving the Independence of the United States of America and attests their abiding friendship . '' </Li> <Li> A tablet placed by the New York committee commemorates the fundraising done to build the pedestal . </Li> <Li> The cornerstone bears a plaque placed by the Freemasons . </Li> <Li> In 1903 , a bronze tablet that bears the text of Emma Lazarus 's sonnet , `` The New Colossus '' ( 1883 ) , was presented by friends of the poet . Until the 1986 renovation , it was mounted inside the pedestal ; today it resides in the Statue of Liberty Museum , in the base . </Li> <Li> `` The New Colossus '' tablet is accompanied by a tablet given by the Emma Lazarus Commemorative Committee in 1977 , celebrating the poet 's life . </Li> </Ul> <P> A group of statues stands at the western end of the island , honoring those closely associated with the Statue of Liberty . Two Americans -- Pulitzer and Lazarus -- and three Frenchmen -- Bartholdi , Eiffel , and Laboulaye -- are depicted . They are the work of Maryland sculptor Phillip Ratner . </P> <H2> UNESCO World Heritage site </H2> <P> In 1984 , the Statue of Liberty was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The UNESCO `` Statement of Significance '' describes the statue as a `` masterpiece of the human spirit '' that `` endures as a highly potent symbol -- inspiring contemplation , debate and protest -- of ideals such as liberty , peace , human rights , abolition of slavery , democracy and opportunity .

A smaller version of the statue , one - fourth the height of the original , was given by the American community in Paris to that city . It now stands on the Île aux Cygnes , facing west toward her larger sister . A replica 30 feet ( 9.1 m ) tall stood atop the Liberty Warehouse on West 64th Street in Manhattan for many years ; it now resides at the Brooklyn Museum . In a patriotic tribute , the Boy Scouts of America , as part of their Strengthen the Arm of Liberty campaign in 1949 -- 1952 , donated about two hundred replicas of the statue , made of stamped copper and 100 inches ( 2,500 mm ) in height , to states and municipalities across the United States . Though not a true replica , the statue known as the Goddess of Democracy temporarily erected during the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 was similarly inspired by French democratic traditions -- the sculptors took care to avoid a direct imitation of the Statue of Liberty . Among other recreations of New York City structures , a replica of the statue is part of the exterior of the New York - New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas . </P> Head of Liberty , U.S. airmail stamp , 1971 issue Reverse side of a Presidential Dollar coin <P> As an American icon , the Statue of Liberty has been depicted on the country 's coinage and stamps . It appeared on commemorative coins issued to mark its 1986 centennial , and on New York 's 2001 entry in the state quarters series . An image of the statue was chosen for the American Eagle platinum bullion coins in 1997 , and it was placed on the reverse , or tails , side of the Presidential Dollar series of circulating coins . Two images of the statue 's torch appear on the current ten - dollar bill . The statue 's intended photographic depiction on a 2010 forever stamp proved instead to be of the replica at the Las Vegas casino . </P> <P> Depictions of the statue have been used by many regional institutions . Between 1986 and 2000 , New York State issued license plates with an outline of the statue to either the front or the side of the serial number . The Women 's National Basketball Association 's New York Liberty use both the statue 's name and its image in their logo , in which the torch 's flame doubles as a basketball . The New York Rangers of the National Hockey League depicted the statue 's head on their third jersey , beginning in 1997 . The National Collegiate Athletic Association 's 1996 Men 's Basketball Final Four , played at New Jersey 's Meadowlands Sports Complex , featured the statue in its logo . The Libertarian Party of the United States uses the statue in its emblem . </P> <P> The statue is a frequent subject in popular culture . In music , it has been evoked to indicate support for American policies , as in Toby Keith 's song `` Courtesy of the Red , White and Blue ( The Angry American ) '' , and in opposition , appearing on the cover of the Dead Kennedys ' album Bedtime for Democracy , which protested the Reagan administration . In film , the torch is the setting for the climax of director Alfred Hitchcock 's 1942 movie Saboteur . The statue makes one of its most famous cinematic appearances in the 1968 picture Planet of the Apes , in which it is seen half - buried in sand . It is knocked over in the science - fiction film Independence Day and in Cloverfield the head is ripped off . In Jack Finney 's time - travel novel Time and Again , the right arm of the statue , on display in the early 1880s in Madison Square Park , plays a crucial role . Robert Holdstock , consulting editor of The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction , wondered in 1979 , </P> <P> Where would science fiction be without the Statue of Liberty ? For decades it has towered or crumbled above the wastelands of deserted ( E ) arth -- giants have uprooted it , aliens have found it curious ... the symbol of Liberty , of optimism , has become a symbol of science fiction 's pessimistic view of the future . </P> <H2> See also </H2> Approximate heights of various notable statues : 1 .

Since January 1971 , the winner of the American Football Conference ( AFC ) Championship Game has faced the winner of the National Football Conference ( NFC ) Championship Game in the culmination of the NFL playoffs . </P> The Packers defeated the Chiefs in the first AFL -- NFL Championship Game ( Super Bowl I ) . <P> Before the 1970 merger between the American Football League ( AFL ) and the National Football League ( NFL ) , the two leagues met in four such contests . The first two were marketed as the `` AFL -- NFL World Championship Game '' , but were also casually referred to as `` the Super Bowl game '' during the television broadcast . Super Bowl III in January 1969 was the first such game that carried the `` Super Bowl '' moniker in official marketing ; the names `` Super Bowl I '' and `` Super Bowl II '' were retroactively applied to the first two games . The NFC / NFL leads in Super Bowl wins with 27 , while the AFC / AFL has won 25 . Twenty franchises , including teams that have relocated to another city , have won the Super Bowl . </P> <P> The Pittsburgh Steelers ( 6 -- 2 ) have won the most Super Bowls with six championships , while the New England Patriots ( 5 -- 5 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 5 -- 3 ) , and the San Francisco 49ers ( 5 -- 1 ) have five wins . New England has the most Super Bowl appearances with ten , while the Buffalo Bills ( 0 -- 4 ) have the most consecutive appearances with four ( all losses ) from 1990 to 1993 . The Miami Dolphins are the only other team to have at least three consecutive appearances : 1972 -- 1974 . The Denver Broncos ( 3 -- 5 ) and Patriots have each lost a record five Super Bowls . The Minnesota Vikings ( 0 -- 4 ) and the Bills have lost four . The record for consecutive wins is two and is shared by seven franchises : the Green Bay Packers ( 1966 -- 1967 ) , the Miami Dolphins ( 1972 -- 1973 ) , the Pittsburgh Steelers ( 1974 -- 1975 and 1978 -- 1979 , the only team to accomplish this feat twice ) , the San Francisco 49ers ( 1988 -- 1989 ) , the Dallas Cowboys ( 1992 -- 1993 ) , the Denver Broncos ( 1997 -- 1998 ) , and the New England Patriots ( 2003 -- 2004 ) . Among those , Dallas ( 1992 -- 1993 ; 1995 ) and New England ( 2001 ; 2003 -- 2004 ) are the only teams to win three out of four consecutive Super Bowls . The 1972 Dolphins capped off the only perfect season in NFL history with their victory in Super Bowl VII . The only team with multiple Super Bowl appearances and no losses is the Baltimore Ravens , who in winning Super Bowl XLVII defeated and replaced the 49ers in that position . Four current NFL teams have never appeared in a Super Bowl , including franchise relocations and renaming : the Cleveland Browns , Detroit Lions , Jacksonville Jaguars , and Houston Texans , though both the Browns ( 1964 ) and Lions ( 1957 ) had won NFL championship games prior to the creation of the Super Bowl . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Super Bowl Championship ( 1966 -- present ) <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Consecutive winners </Li> <Li> 1.2 Consecutive losers </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Super Bowl appearances by team <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Teams with no Super Bowl appearances </Li> <Li> 2.2 Teams with long Super Bowl droughts </Li> <Li> 2.3 Teams with Super Bowl appearances but no victories </Li> <Li> 2.4 Super Bowl rematches </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 See also </Li> <Li> 4 Notes </Li> <Li> 5 References </Li> <Li> 6 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Super Bowl championship ( 1966 -- present ) </H2> <P> Numbers in parentheses in the table are Super Bowl appearances as of the date of that Super Bowl and are used as follows : </P> <Ul> <Li> Winning team and losing team columns indicate the number of times that team has appeared in a Super Bowl as well as each respective teams ' Super Bowl record to date . </Li> <Li> Venue column indicates number of times that stadium has hosted a Super Bowl . </Li> <Li> City column indicates number of times that metropolitan area has hosted a Super Bowl . </Li> </Ul> <Table> <Tr> <Th> National Football League ( NFL , 1967 -- 1970 ) </Th> <Th> American Football League ( AFL , 1967 -- 1970 ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> NFL champion ( 4 , 2 -- 2 ) </Td> <Td> AFL champion ( 4 , 2 -- 2 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> National Football Conference ( NFC , 1971 -- present ) </Th> <Th> American Football Conference ( AFC , 1971 -- present ) </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> NFC champion ( 48 , 25 -- 23 ) </Td> <Td> AFC champion ( 48 , 23 -- 25 ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Game </Th> <Th> Date </Th> <Th> Winning team </Th> <Th> Score </Th> <Th> Losing team </Th> <Th> Venue </Th> <Th> City </Th> <Th> Attendance </Th> <Th> Ref </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 01 !

Two of them held NFL league championships prior to Super Bowl I in the 1966 NFL season : </P> <Ul> <Li> Cleveland Browns , NFL champions four times in 1950 , 1954 , 1955 , and 1964 ; appeared in seven other NFL championship games in 1951 , 1952 , 1953 , 1957 , 1965 , 1968 , and 1969 ; and appeared in three AFC Championship Games in 1986 , 1987 , and 1989 . The Browns are officially viewed as one continuous franchise that began in 1946 as a member of the All - America Football Conference , joined the NFL in 1950 , suspended operations from 1996 to 1998 , and resumed play in 1999 . The Baltimore Ravens were created as an expansion team with former Browns players in 1996 , and have since won two Super Bowls . </Li> <Li> Detroit Lions , NFL champions four times in 1935 , 1952 , 1953 , and 1957 ; appeared in one other NFL Championship Game in 1954 ; and appeared in one NFC Championship Game in 1991 </Li> <Li> Jacksonville Jaguars , 1995 expansion team ; appeared in three AFC Championship Games in 1996 , 1999 , and 2017 . </Li> <Li> Houston Texans , 2002 expansion team ; Divisional Round appearances in 2011 , 2012 , and 2016 seasons . </Li> </Ul> <P> In addition , Detroit , Houston , and Jacksonville have hosted Super Bowls , making Cleveland the only current NFL city that has neither hosted nor had its team play in a Super Bowl . </P> <H3> Teams with long Super Bowl droughts </H3> The Jets ' last championship appearance was their victory over the Colts in Super Bowl III . <P> Although Jacksonville and Houston have never appeared in a Super Bowl , there are teams whose most recent Super Bowl appearance is older than when Jacksonville and Houston joined the NFL ( 1995 and 2002 , respectively ) , resulting in longer Super Bowl droughts than these teams for the following eight teams . </P> <P> Two of these teams have not appeared in the Super Bowl since before the AFL -- NFL merger in 1970 : </P> <Ul> <Li> New York Jets ( most recently appeared in Super Bowl III , 1968 season ) </Li> <Li> Kansas City Chiefs ( Super Bowl IV in 1969 season ) </Li> </Ul> <P> However , the Jets and the Chiefs are the only non-NFL teams to win the Super Bowl , both being members of the now - defunct AFL at the time . </P> <P> The most recent Super Bowl appearance for the following teams was after the AFL -- NFL merger , but prior to the 1995 regular season : </P> <Ul> <Li> Minnesota Vikings ( Super Bowl XI , 1976 season ) </Li> <Li> Miami Dolphins ( Super Bowl XIX , 1984 season ) </Li> <Li> Cincinnati Bengals ( Super Bowl XXIII , 1988 season ) </Li> <Li> Washington Redskins ( Super Bowl XXVI , 1991 season ) </Li> <Li> Buffalo Bills ( Super Bowl XXVIII , 1993 season ) </Li> <Li> Los Angeles Chargers ( played as San Diego Chargers in Super Bowl XXIX , 1994 season ) </Li> </Ul> <H3> Teams with Super Bowl appearances but no victories </H3> <P> Eight teams have appeared in the Super Bowl without ever winning .

He is a lawyer and was once known as `` the deadliest shot in Maycomb County '' . Although he was a good shot , he does not like to mention the fact as he does not like the thought of having an advantage over people . He appears to support racial equality and was appointed to represent Tom Robinson , a black man who has been accused of raping a young white woman , Mayella Ewell . The town disapproves of him defending Tom especially when he makes clear his intent to defend Tom Robinson to the best of his abilities . He is portrayed by Gregory Peck in the film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <H3> `` Scout '' Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jean Louise `` Scout '' Finch is the narrator and To Kill a Mockingbird is told by an adult Scout who often comments on how she could not understand something at the time but now can appreciate it . She gets in trouble with her teacher Miss Caroline because Miss Caroline expects Scout to learn reading and writing her way . She is a tomboy and spends the most of her time with her brother Jem and best friend Dill . To Jem 's advice to pretend to be a lady and start sewing or something , she answers ' Hell no . ' The rare hints the narrator gives us about her grown - up life reveal that she ultimately has n't changed herself for others . </P> <P> She matures from age 6 to age 9 as the novel progresses but remains naive and idealistic , despite an increased understanding of human nature and racism in her town . At the beginning of the book , Scout is confused by some of the words and names she hears people directing towards her father , such as `` nigger - lover '' . Being only six , Scout does not know how to handle such situations so she tries to resolve her problems by fighting , or by talking to Atticus about what she has heard . By the end of the book , Scout realizes that racism does exist and comes to terms with its presence in her town . Scout also learns how to deal with others , including the Finch family housekeeper , Calpurnia , and her aunt , Alexandra . Scout is the only one of the novel 's primary three children ( Dill , Jem , and herself ) to see and speak to Boo Radley during the course of the novel and realize that he is harmless , despite her initial fear of him . She also stops a mob that is trying to lynch Tom Robinson by talking to the mob leader , Mr. Cunningham , about inviting his son , Walter , over for dinner . Mr. Cunningham then tells the other mob members to get back in their cars and leave them alone . The members listen , and Scout unintentionally saves Tom Robinson 's life . She is portrayed by Mary Badham in the film adaption of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <P> Notable quote : `` Until I feared I would lose it , I never loved to read . One does not love breathing . '' </P> <H3> `` Jem '' Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jeremy Atticus `` Jem '' Finch is Atticus ' son and Scout 's older brother by four years . Jem matures greatly throughout the course of the novel , much more affected by events than Scout seems to be . Being four years Scout 's senior , Jem is seen to have a greater understanding of - and therefore greater difficulty in navigating - the obstacles thrown their way . Jem is seen explaining many things to Scout throughout the novel . Bob Ewell breaks Jem 's arm during his assault on the Finch children , subsequently resulting in it being shorter than it had been , in an attempt to protect his sister . He is portrayed by Phillip Alford in the film adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <H3> Dill Harris ( edit ) </H3> <P> Charles Baker `` Dill '' Harris is a short , smart boy who visits Maycomb every summer from Meridian , Mississippi , and stays with his Aunt Rachel ( Aunt Stephanie in the film ) . Dill is the best friend of both Jem and Scout , and his goal throughout the novel is to get Boo Radley to come out of his house . The children concoct many plans to lure Boo Radley out of his house for a few summers until Atticus tells them to stop . In chapter 5 of the novel , Dill promises to marry Scout and they become `` engaged '' . One night Dill runs away from his home in Meridian , arriving in Maycomb County where he hides under Scout 's bed . When she finds Dill , he tells both Scout and Atticus that he was chained to a wall in his father 's basement ; later , he confesses he actually ran away because he felt he was being replaced by his stepfather . Before Dill returned to Meridian after the summer , he went swimming with Jem at the Barker 's Eddy creek . Scout , unfortunately , was unable to participate , because both boys were swimming naked . </P> <P> Unlike Scout and Jem , Dill lacks the security of family support . He is unwanted and unloved by his mother and stepfather : `` They do get on a lot better without me , I can not help them any . '' As Francis ( a cousin of Jem and Scout ) says , `` He has n't got a home , he just gets passed around from relative to relative . '' Dill maintains he has no father ; he does n't know where his father might live , or if he will ever come back . He is played by John Megna in the film adaption of To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <P> This character is believed to be based on author Truman Capote , a childhood friend of Harper Lee . </P> <H3> Calpurnia ( edit ) </H3> <P> Calpurnia , nicknamed Cal , is the Finch family 's African - American housekeeper , whom the children love and Atticus deeply respects ( he remarks in her defense that she `` never indulged ( the children ) like most colored nurses '' ) . She is highly regarded by Atticus . She is an important figure in Scout 's life , providing discipline , instruction , and love . She also fills the maternal role for the children after their mother 's death . Calpurnia is a mother herself and raised her son , Zeebo , to adulthood . Calpurnia is one of the few black characters in the novel who is able to read and write , and it is she who taught Scout to write . She learned how to read from Miss Maudie 's aunt , Miss Buford , who taught her how to read out of Blackstone 's Commentaries , a book given to her . Aunt Alexandra despised Calpurnia because Alexandra believed that Calpurnia was not a `` maternal figure '' for Jem and Scout , especially for Scout . </P> <P> Calpurnia is a member of the First Purchase M.E. African Church in Maycomb . While Scout always hears her speak proper English , she is surprised to learn that Calpurnia does not do so at church , especially with the uneducated members of the congregation . </P> <P> While everyone in the novel is filtered through Scout 's perception , Calpurnia in particular appears for a long time more as Scout 's idea of her than as a real person . At the beginning of the novel , Scout appears to think of Calpurnia as the wicked stepmother to Scout 's own Cinderella . However , towards the end of the book , Scout views Calpurnia as someone she can look up to , and realizes Calpurnia has only protected her over the years . She is played by Estelle Evans in the film . </P> <H3> Arthur `` Boo '' Radley ( edit ) </H3> <P> Arthur `` Boo '' Radley is a recluse in To Kill a Mockingbird . </P> <P> Maycomb children believe he is a horrible person , due to the rumors spread about him and a trial he underwent as a teenager . It is implied during the story that Boo is a very lonely man who attempts to reach out to Jem and Scout for love and friendship , such as leaving them small gifts and figures in a tree knothole . Scout finally meets him at the very end of the book , when he saves the children 's lives from Bob Ewell . Scout describes him as being sickly white , with a thin mouth , thin and feathery hair , and grey eyes , almost as if he were blind . During the same night , when Boo whispers to Scout to walk him back to the Radley house , Scout takes a moment to picture what it would be like to be Boo Radley . While standing on his porch , she realizes his `` exile '' inside his house is really not that lonely . </P> <P> Boo Radley 's heroics in protecting the children from Bob Ewell are covered up by Atticus , Sheriff Tate , and Scout . This can be read as a wise refusal of fame . As Tate notes , if word got out that Boo killed Ewell , Boo would be inundated with gifts and visits , calamitous for him due to his reclusive personality . The precocious Scout recognizes the danger : renown would `` kill the mockingbird '' . Boo Radley is a ghost who haunts the book yet manifests himself at just the right moments in just the right way . He is , arguably , the most potent character in the whole book and as such , inspires the other key characters to save him when he needs saving . </P> <P> After the Tom Robinson trial , Jem and Scout have a different understanding of Boo Radley . `` Scout , I think I 'm beginning to understand something . I think I 'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley 's stayed shut up in the house all this time ... it 's because he wants to stay inside . '' ( 23.117 ) Having seen a sample of the horrible things their fellow townspeople can do , choosing to stay out of the mess of humanity does n't seem like such a strange choice . </P> <P> When Boo finally does come out , he has a good reason : Bob Ewell is trying to murder the Finch children . No one sees what happens in the scuffle , but at the end of it , Ewell is dead and Boo carries an unconscious Jem to the Finch house . Finally faced with Boo , Scout does n't recognize him at first , but suddenly realizes who he is . Boo Radley is played by Robert Duvall in the film . </P> <H3> Judge John Taylor ( edit ) </H3> <P> Judge John Taylor is a white - haired old man with a reputation for running his court in an informal fashion and an enjoyment of singing and dipping tobacco . He is unimportant to the children until he presides over the Tom Robinson trial , in which he shows great distaste for the Ewells and great respect for Atticus . Because of the judge 's sympathies for Tom , Bob Ewell breaks into the judge 's house while the judge 's wife is at church . After the trial , Miss Maudie points out to the children that the judge had tried to help Tom by appointing Atticus to the case instead of Maxwell Green , the new , untried lawyer who usually received court - appointed cases . Judge Taylor knew that Atticus was the only man who would stand a chance at acquitting Tom , or at least would be able to keep the jury thinking for more than just a few minutes . By doing this , Judge Taylor was not giving in or supporting racism . He is portrayed in the film by Paul Fix . </P> <H3> Miss Maudie Atkinson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Maude `` Maudie '' Atkinson lives across the street from the Finch family . She had known the Finches for many years , having been brought up on the Buford place , which was near the Finches ' ancestral home , Finch 's Landing . She is described as a woman of about 50 who enjoys baking and gardening ; her cakes are especially held in high regard . However , she is frequently harassed by devout `` Foot - Washing Baptists '' , who tell her that her enjoyment of gardening is a sin . The Foot - Washing Baptists also believe that women are a sin as well . Miss Maudie befriends Scout and Jem and tells them stories about Atticus as a boy . It is strongly implied that she and Atticus have a more than platonic relationship . Also , she is one of the few adults that Jem and Scout hold in high regard and respect . She does not act condescendingly towards them , even though they are young children . During the course of the novel , her house burns down ; however , she shows remarkable courage throughout this ( even saying that she wanted to burn it down herself to make more room for her flowers ) . She is not prejudiced , though she talks caustically to Miss Stephanie Crawford , unlike many of her Southern neighbors , and teaches Scout important lessons about racism and human nature . It is important to note that Miss Maudie fully explains that `` it is a sin to kill a mockingbird '' , whereas Atticus Finch initially brings up the subject but does n't go into depth . When Jem gets older , and does n't want to be bothered by Scout , Miss Maudie keeps her from getting angry . Maudie is played by Rosemary Murphy in the film . </P> <H3> Robert E. Lee `` Bob '' Ewell ( edit ) </H3> <P> Robert E. Lee `` Bob '' Ewell is the main antagonist of To Kill a Mockingbird . He has a daughter named Mayella and a younger son named Burris , as well as six other unnamed children . He is an alcoholic , poaching game to feed his family because he spends whatever money they legally gain via government `` relief checks '' on alcohol . It is implied , and evidence suggests , that he was the one who abused his daughter Mayella , not Tom Robinson ( the African American man accused of doing so ) . Although most everybody in town knows that the Ewells are a disgrace and not to be trusted , it is made clear that Tom Robinson was convicted because he is a Negro whose accuser is white . Upon hearing of Tom 's death , Bob is absolutely gleeful , gloating about his success . After being humiliated at the trial , however , he goes on a quest for revenge , becoming increasingly violent . He begins by spitting in Atticus ' face , followed by a failed attempt to break into the home of Judge Taylor , then finally menacing Helen , the poor widow of Tom Robinson . Ewell later attempts to murder Jem and Scout Finch with a knife to complete his revenge . Boo Radley saves Jem and Scout and it is believed that he kills Ewell with the knife . Heck Tate , the sheriff , puts in the official report that Bob Ewell fell on his own knife and died after lying under a tree for 45 minutes . Ewell is played by James Anderson in the film . </P> <H3> Mayella Ewell ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mayella Violet Ewell , 19 , is the oldest of the eight Ewell children . Before the trial , Mayella is noted for growing red geraniums outside her otherwise dirty home in order to bring some beauty into her life . Due to her family 's living situation , Mayella has no opportunity for human contact or love . She eventually gets so desperate that she attempts to seduce a black man , Tom Robinson , by saving up nickels to send her siblings to go get ice cream so that Mayella can be alone with Tom . Her father sees this through a window and in punishment he beats her . Ewell then finds the sheriff , Heck Tate , and tells him that his daughter has been raped and beaten by Tom . At the trial , Atticus points out that only the right side of Mayella 's face is injured , suggesting a left - handed assailant ; Tom 's left arm is mangled and useless , but Bob Ewell is left - handed . When Atticus asks her if she has any friends , she becomes confused because she does not know what a friend is . During her testimony she is confused by Atticus ' polite speech and thinks that his use of `` Miss Mayella '' is meant to mock her . She testifies against Tom Robinson . Mayella is played by Collin Wilcox in the film . </P> <H3> Tom Robinson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Thomas `` Tom '' Robinson is an African - American who is put on trial for the rape of a white woman , Mayella Ewell . Atticus is assigned to defend him , and stands up to a lynch mob intent on exacting their own justice against him before the trial begins . Tom 's left arm is crippled and useless , the result of an accident with a cotton gin when he was a child . Atticus uses this fact as the cornerstone of his defense strategy , pointing out that the nature of Mayella 's facial injuries strongly suggest a left - handed assailant . Tom testifies that he had frequently helped Mayella with household chores because he felt sorry for her and the family 's difficult life - a statement that shocks the all - white , male jury . Despite Atticus ' skilled defense , the jury 's racial prejudices lead them to find Tom guilty . Atticus plans to appeal the verdict , but before he can do so , Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape the prison where he is being held . Tom Robinson is played by Brock Peters . </P> <H3> Aunt Alexandra ( edit ) </H3> <P> Alexandra Hancock ( née Finch ) is Atticus ' and Jack 's sister , married to James `` Uncle Jimmy '' Hancock . She has a son named Henry and a very spoiled grandson named Francis . Around the middle of the book , Aunt Alexandra decides to leave her husband at Finch 's Landing , the Finch family homestead to come stay with the Finches . Aunt Alexandra does n't consider the black Calpurnia to be a very good motherly figure for Jem and Scout ; she disapproves of Scout being a tomboy and wants to make Scout into a southern belle ( encouraging her to act more ' lady like ' ) . This is the cause of many conflicts between Scout and Alexandra throughout the course of the novel . However , as the trial progresses , Scout comes to see how much her aunt cares for her father and what a strong woman she is . This is especially evidenced by a tea party when Scout is horrified by the racism displayed , and her aunt and Miss Maudie help her deal with her feelings . By the end of the book , it 's clear that Alexandra cares very much for her niece and nephew , though she and Scout will probably never really get along . </P> <H2> Minor characters ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Jack Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> John Hale `` Jack '' Finch is Atticus ' and Alexandra 's younger brother . ( He is about 40 , which is 10 years younger than Atticus . ) Jack smells like alcohol and something sweet , and is said that he and Alexandra have similar features . Jack is a childless doctor who can always make Scout and Jem laugh , and they adore him . He and Miss Maudie are close to the same age ; he frequently teases her with marriage proposals , which she always declines . Jack also has a pet cat named Rose Aylmer , who is mentioned during the Christmas visit . </P> <H3> Francis Hancock ( edit ) </H3> <P> Francis Hancock is the spoiled grandson of Aunt Alexandra . ( The son of her son , Henry Hancock . ) Every Christmas , Henry and his wife drop Francis at Finch 's Landing , which is the only time Scout and Jem see him . Francis lives in Mobile , Alabama , and is a bit of a tattle - tale . He gets along well with Jem , but often spars with Scout . One Christmas , Francis calls Atticus a `` nigger - lover , '' as well as insisting that he was ruining the family and the likes , which infuriates Scout and causes them to get into a fight . Francis lies about his role in it , telling Uncle Jack that Scout started it by calling him a `` whore lady '' , and Jack therefore punishes Scout . However , she explains the full story and charitably persuades her uncle not to punish Francis about it , but to let Atticus think they had been fighting about something else ( although Atticus later discovers the truth ) . </P> <H3> Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose is an elderly woman who lives near the Finches . She is hated by the children , who run by her house to avoid her . Scout describes Mrs. Dubose as `` plain hell . '' A virulent racist , she calls Atticus a `` nigger - lover '' to his children 's faces , and Jem flies into a rage and ravages Mrs. Dubose 's camellia bushes . As a punishment , Jem is required to read to Mrs. Dubose each day for a month . As Jem reads , she experiences a fit of drooling and twitching and does not seem to pay any attention to the words . When an alarm rings , Jem is allowed to leave for the day . She extends the punishment for one extra week and dies shortly after letting Jem go for the last time . Atticus informs him that Mrs. Dubose was terminally ill and had become addicted to morphine . By reading to her , Jem had distracted her so that she could break the addiction . In thanks , she leaves him a candy box with a camellia flower in it ; Jem burns the box in anger , but is later seen by Scout admiring the flower . Atticus tells Jem that Mrs. Dubose was the bravest person he ever knew , and she was trying to teach Jem the importance of bravery and true courage to endure anything when the situation is hopeless , as in her morphine addiction . </P> <H3> Mr. Heck Tate ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Heck Tate is a friend of Atticus and also the sheriff of Maycomb County . He believes in protecting the innocent although he does n't usually show it . At the end of the book , the Atticus and Heck argue over whether Jem or Boo Radley should be held responsible for the death of Bob Ewell . Heck eventually persuades Atticus to accept the theory that Ewell accidentally fell on his own knife , thus saving the harmless , reclusive Boo from the public exposure of a criminal trial . </P> <H3> Mr. Braxton Underwood ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Braxton Bragg Underwood is a news reporter and a friend of Atticus . He owns and also publishes The Maycomb Tribune . Being a racist , he disagrees with Atticus on principle . He also has a strong belief in justice , as exemplified when he defends Atticus from the Cunningham mob by having his double barrel shotgun loaded and ready to shoot them . He also demonstrates some humanity when he publishes a scathing editorial comparing the killing of Tom Robinson ( a cripple ) to `` the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters and children '' . </P> <H3> Mr. Horace Gilmer ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Horace Gilmer is a lawyer from Abbottsville , and is the prosecuting attorney in the Tom Robinson case . Mr. Gilmer is between the ages of forty and sixty . Mr. Gilmer has a slight cast with one eye , which he uses to his advantage in trial . Mr. Gilmer appeared to be racist in his harsh cross-examination of Tom Robinson , but it is hinted at that he is in fact going easy on Tom . He and Atticus are not rivals and talk to each other during recesses during the case . </P> <H3> Dr. Reynolds ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dr. Reynolds is the Maycomb doctor . He is well known to Scout and Jem . Scout says that he `` had brought Jem and me into the world , had led us through every childhood disease known to man including the time Jem fell out of the tree house , and he had never lost our friendship . Dr. Reynolds said that if we were boil - prone things would have been different ... '' . He inspects Jem 's broken arm and Scout 's minor bruises after the attack from Bob Ewell under the tree . </P> <H3> Dolphus Raymond ( edit ) </H3> <P> Dolphus Raymond is a white landowner who is jaded by the hypocrisy of the white society and prefers to live among black folks . In fact , he has children with a black woman . Dolphus pretends he is an alcoholic so that the people of Maycomb will have an excuse for his behavior , but in fact he only drinks Coca Cola out of a paper bag to try to hide it . When Dill and Scout discover that he is not a drunk , they are amazed . He shows Scout how sometimes you can pretend to be someone you 're not so people will be more understanding of you . </P> <H3> Link Deas ( edit ) </H3> <P> Link Deas owns cotton fields and a store in Maycomb who employs Tom and later Helen because she does not get accepted by any other employers in the county due to Tom Robinson 's legal troubles . He announces to the court ( in defense of Tom ) at one point in the trial that he had n't `` had a speck o ' trouble outta him '' in the eight years Tom had been working for him , and gets sent out by Judge John Taylor for doing so . When Bob Ewell starts threatening Helen after the trial , Mr. Deas fiercely defends her and threatens to have Mr. Ewell arrested if he keeps bothering her . He is on Tom Robinson 's side during the trial and remains loyal to the family afterward . </P> <H3> Miss Caroline Fisher ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Caroline Fisher is Scout 's first grade teacher and is new to Maycomb , Alabama and its ways . She attempts to teach the first grade class using a new system which she learned from taking certain college courses ( Jem mistakenly refers to it as the `` Dewey Decimal System '' , which is really how library books are organized . ) . She is upset by Scout 's advanced reading capabilities and believes that Scout is receiving lessons from Atticus . She feels as though Scout is trying to outsmart and mock her . In an effort to standardize the class , she forbids Scout from reading with her father . Atticus asks Scout to step into Miss Caroline 's skin . However , he continues to allow Scout to read with him at night so long as she continues to go to school . Miss Caroline has good intentions but proves quite incompetent as a teacher . When Scout tells Miss Fisher that she shamed a student ( Walter Cunningham , Jr . ) by giving him lunch money , she raps Scout 's palms with a ruler ( a punishment unheard of in Maycomb ) . She is also very sensitive and gets emotionally hurt quite easily , as seen when she cries after Burris Ewell yells at her , `` Report and be damned to ye ! Ai n't no snot - nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born c'n make me do nothin ' ! You ai n't makin ' me go nowhere , missus . You just remember that , you ai n't makin ' me go nowhere ! '' After the Burris Ewell incident , Miss Caroline is seldom seen and soon forgotten . </P> <H3> Reverend Sykes ( edit ) </H3> <P> Reverend Sykes is the reverend of the First Purchase M.E. African Church in Maycomb County , where most if not all of the African - American characters go to church . Reverend Sykes forces the congregation to donate 10 dollars for Tom Robinson 's family since at the time , Tom 's wife , Helen , was having trouble finding work . During the trial , when the courtroom was too packed for the children to find seats , Reverend Sykes lets the kids sit with him up in the colored balcony and even saves their seats for them . </P> <H3> Miss Stephanie Crawford ( edit ) </H3> <P> Stephanie Crawford is the neighborhood gossip who claimed that she saw Boo Radley from her bedroom standing outside of her cleaned window one night . Crawford is one of the first on the scene after a loud gunshot is heard behind the Radley house . Because she is the neighborhood gossip , it is unwise to think of anything that she says as true , because most of the time it is not true at all . She is a friend of Alexandra Hancock . She lets Miss Maudie live with her when Miss Maudie 's house burns down , supposedly in order to steal Miss Maudie 's Lane cake recipe . She is thrilled to pass on gossip to the kids about Boo Radley . She claimed to have witnessed Bob Ewell 's threatening Atticus at the Post Office corner as she was returning from the local Jitney Jungle grocery store . </P> <P> In the film , she takes the place of Rachel Haverford and is now Dill 's aunt . </P> <H3> Miss Rachel Haverford ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Rachel Haverford is Dill 's aunt and the Finches ' next door neighbor . She drank neat whiskey heavily after seeing a rattlesnake coiled in her closet , on her washing , when she hung her negligee up . Even though she can be very hard to deal with , she truly does love her nephew . Her family name , in the legends of Maycomb County , is synonymous with jackass . She is also a Southern Belle . </P> <P> In the film , she is not a character and Miss Stephanie takes her place as Dill 's aunt . </P> <H3> Helen Robinson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Helen Robinson is the wife of Tom Robinson . She is spoken about a few times . She has three children . Employed by Link Deas following the death of her husband , she is repeatedly harassed by Bob Ewell when traveling to work . Upon learning of this , Deas threatens Ewell , forcing him to stop . She is an example of how one person 's actions can have an effect on a lot of people and she elucidates the hardships that surround the Tom Robinson case . </P> <H3> Nathan Radley ( edit ) </H3> <P> Nathan Radley is the brother of Arthur `` Boo '' Radley and another difficult character to understand in To Kill a Mockingbird . When the children try to catch a view of `` Boo '' late one night through a window , he shoots over their heads with a shotgun ( albeit thinking he was aiming at a black person ) . Nathan also cements up the knothole in which Arthur leaves little gifts for the children . On the other hand , he helps Miss Maudie by saving some of her belongings when her house is on fire . He is more present than his brother , but equally mysterious . </P> <H3> Jessie ( edit ) </H3> <P> Jessie is Mrs. Dubose 's black nurse . She is the woman who shoos the children out when Mrs. Dubose has her fits , and she seems to care enormously for Mrs. Dubose . When Jem is forced to stay reading to Mrs. Dubose , Jessie kindly leads Jem and Scout to the door when Mrs. Dubose 's alarm goes off . The rumors about Mrs. Dubose concealing a gun about her person involves Jessie ; the book says `` and even if Mrs. Dubose missed , her girl Jessie would n't '' . </P> <H3> Burris Ewell ( edit ) </H3> <P> Burris Ewell is a son of Bob Ewell and a younger sibling of Mayella Ewell as well as the first antagonist of the novel . Burris is described as being chiefly antagonistic of Little Chuck Little and his teacher Miss Caroline Fisher . He comes to the first day of school , but departs just as everyone else in his family does . Burris is also poor . He has live lice in his hair . Burris also scared his teacher Caroline Fisher . He behaves rudely when she tells him to go home , wash his hair , and come back clean the next day . He refuses , and a student explains to Miss Caroline that Ewell children do n't attend school . All they do is show up for the first day , get marked down on the register , and then they miss the entire school year until the first day of the next year . His famous quote was , `` Report and be damned to ye ! Ai n't no snot - nosed slut of a schoolteacher ever born c'n make me do nothin ' ! You ai n't makin ' me go nowhere , missus . You just remember that , you ai n't makin ' me go nowhere ! '' As of Scout 's first year of school ( the first grade ) , Burris has repeated the first grade three times . Burris is also like his father and is very belligerent . </P> <H3> Lula ( edit ) </H3> <P> Lula is an African - American woman with a dislike for white people . She does n't like the idea of Calpurnia bringing Atticus Finch 's children , Jem and Scout , with her to church and tells her so but is overruled by the other congregants . According to James Zeebo , Calpurnia 's son , Lula 's said to be , `` a troublemaker from way back , with fancy ideas and haughty ways . '' She 's threatened with being `` churched '' ( subjected to church discipline ) by Reverend Sykes . </P> <H3> Mrs. Grace Merriweather ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mrs. Grace Merriweather is the producer of the play in which Scout plays as a ham . She tells Everett that `` the ladies of the South Maycomb Alabama Methodist Episcopal Church are behind him one hundred percent . '' She is mostly known for her devotion to the church and is widely held as the most devout lady in Maycomb ; however , like many of her peers , she is very hypocritical and loves to gossip with all the other women . </P> <H3> Walter Cunningham , Jr. ( edit ) </H3> <P> Walter Cunningham , Jr. is a child who is almost as old as Jem but is in Scout 's class . He lives on a farm . He is too poor to even pay off a 25 - cent debt because the Great Depression hit his poor family hard . He does n't take money because his family ca n't pay people back in cash . His father paid Atticus for his service for something a while back with some goods . Walter is invited over to the Finches ' house once , after engaging in a fight with Scout , where he covers up all of his dinner with molasses , much to Scout 's vocal dismay . This teaches Scout a lesson in humility and compassion . </P> <H3> Walter Cunningham , Sr. ( edit ) </H3> <P> Walter Cunningham , Sr. is Walter Cunningham Jr. 's father . He appears only twice , once at the beginning of the story when he has to pay off the debt to Atticus ( Walter Cunningham Sr. was his client ) by giving him firewood , vegetables and other supplies . He also leads the mob that comes to lynch Tom Robinson the night before the trial . Only when Scout talks to him about his son and how much he owes to Atticus does he reconsider and call off the mob . Scout innocently shames him because Scout reminds him of all the things that Atticus has done for him and for Maycomb County . After the verdict is given in the trial , Atticus tells Jem that one of the Cunninghams had changed his thoughts about Tom and pleaded that Tom was not guilty to the jury . </P> <H3> Little Chuck Little ( edit ) </H3> <P> Little Chuck Little is a student in Scout 's first - grade class who has the mindset of an adult . His real name is Charles . He is depicted as chiefly antagonistic of Burris Ewell . He is presented in the novel when Miss Caroline is frightened by Burris ' lice . He warned Miss Caroline that if Burris was n't released from class , he might try something that would put their classmates at risk . When Burris starts advancing on Little Chuck after his warning / veiled insult , Little Chuck 's hand moved to his pocket ( implying that he was going to pull out a knife ) while saying , `` Watch your step , Burris . I 'd soon 's kill you as look at you . Now go home . '' Scared by Little Chuck 's bravery and his implied knife , Burris retreats . From this we see , through the narrative view of Scout , his gentlemanly attitude and how it calms Miss Caroline down . Little Chuck may be even more intelligent than originally meets the eye , as he easily could have been bluffing about the aforementioned implied knife to scare Burris into retreating . </P> <H3> Mr. Dick Avery ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Dick Avery is an overweight neighbor who tells Jem and Scout that dramatic changes in the weather are caused by disobedient and misbehaving children . After it snows , they build a snowman that resembles him . Mr. Avery can also be seen in the story pushing a mattress out of a window when Miss Maudie 's house catches fire . The kids , including Jem and Scout , always waited for him to do something interesting . For instance , Jem claims that one night he urinated from his front porch in an impressive arc . </P> <H3> Miss Gates ( edit ) </H3> <P> Miss Gates is a third grade teacher at Scout 's school who insists that America is n't prejudiced like Hitler 's Germany .

Scout almost gets into a fight with Cecil over the trial of Tom Robinson . Scout beats up Cecil Jacobs because he says Atticus is a `` Nigger Lover . '' He gives a current event on Adolf Hitler and later frightens Scout and Jem on their way to the Halloween pageant . He and Scout then pair up at the carnival . At the Halloween pageant afterwards , Cecil was a cow . He hints that black people are not as good as white people while talking about Hitler during current events . He also tends to take jokes too far . However importantly he shows how prejudice is passed on from parent to child . </P> <H3> Tim Johnson ( edit ) </H3> <P> Tim Johnson is a dog belonging to Harry Johnson ( a character in the book who is mentioned once but is never seen ) . He is infected by rabies in chapter 10 and goes mad , putting everyone in the town at risk . Atticus is forced to shoot Tim Johnson before he reaches the Radley House or attacks anyone . When Atticus shoots the dog , his excellent marksmanship is revealed to Scout and Jem ( his nickname used to be One - Shot Finch ) . The dog 's body is collected by Zeebo . </P> <H3> Simon Finch ( edit ) </H3> <P> Simon Finch is the founder of Finch 's Landing . He is referred to in the first chapter of the book , being a direct ancestor of Atticus .

He is also an apothecary . </P> <H3> Maxwell Green ( edit ) </H3> <P> Maxwell Green is the new lawyer in town . He is normally the judicially - assigned defense attorney but Judge Taylor assigned Tom Robinson 's case to Atticus to give Tom Robinson a better chance . </P> <H3> Mr. X Billups ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. X Billups who is seen only once in the book , going to the trial , is described as a `` funny man '' . X is his name , and not his initial . He was asked repeated times what his name was until he signed it . X was the name he had been given when he was born because his parents marked his birth certificate with an X instead of a name . </P> <H3> The Barber sisters ( Miss `` Tutti '' and Miss `` Frutti '' ) ( edit ) </H3> <P> The Barber Sisters ( Miss Sarah , nicknamed `` Tutti '' and Miss Frances , nicknamed `` Frutti '' ) are maiden sisters who live in the only house in Maycomb with a cellar . They were originally from Clanton , Alabama ; and are rumored to be Republicans . Besides their Yankee ways , both sisters are deaf ( Tutti completely deaf ; Frutti uses an ear trumpet ) , and had a Halloween prank pulled on them by some `` wicked '' schoolchildren ( Scout claims she was not included ) who put all of their furniture in their cellar . </P> <H3> Mrs. gertrude Farrow ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mrs. Farrow is a lady in the missionary society who visits the Finch house occasionally . </P> <H3> Mr. Conner ( edit ) </H3> <P> Mr. Conner is mentioned early on in the book . He was locked in an outhouse by `` Boo '' Radley and his friends . After taking the teenagers to court , Mr. Conner accused them of `` disorderly conduct , disturbing the peace , assault and battery , and using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female . '' He added the last charge after claiming that the teens had `` cussed so loud he was sure every lady in Maycomb heard them . '' </P> <H3> Zeebo ( edit ) </H3> <P> Calpurnia 's eldest son , Zeebo , was taught how to read by Calpurnia . Zeebo is one of just four people in First Purchase Church who can read , so he is the vocal leader , leading hymns in their church by `` lining '' -- reading a line of verse and having the congregation repeat it . He is also the garbage man of Maycomb , and took away the dead rabid dog , Tim Johnson . When Lula , a fellow church member tries to make Scout and Jem feel bad for attending church with Calpurnia , Zeebo welcomes them with open arms . </P> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ `` What Kids Are Reading : The Book Reading Habits of Students in American Schools '' , Renaissance Learning , Inc. , 2008 .

While exploring the ruins , Klaus finds a broken spyglass with an insignia of an eye embedded on the front . Shortly afterwards , they are sent to live with their distant relative Count Olaf , a cruel and vain amateur actor , who forces them into servitude . One night , the siblings prepare puttanesca for Olaf 's theatre troupe only for him to demand roast beef upon arriving home . The children state that they were never asked to prepare roast beef , angering Olaf and prompting him to slap Klaus across the face when he protests about the sleeping arrangements .

When Olaf gives Violet the starring role in his latest theatrical production , which ends with the two main characters being married , the siblings realize that Olaf intends to acquire their fortune by marrying Violet for real . Klaus confronts Olaf , who threatens to kill Sunny if Violet does n't follow through with his plans . At the very last minute , however , Violet signs the marriage certificate with her left hand , invalidating the proceedings due to the fact that she is right - handed . Mr. Poe 's mysterious secretary Jacquelyn reveals they were intended to be put in the care of their distant relative Montgomery Montgomery .

While attempting to learn more about Montgomery , Klaus discovers that the hedge maze in Montgomery 's garden is exactly the same shape as the tattoo on Olaf 's ankle . Olaf poses as Montgomery 's new assistant Stephano and attempts to kidnap the Baudelaires , but Monty assures the Baudelaires that he recognizes Stephano as a threat . The four arrive at a movie theatre , where Monty deciphers a code sent for him through the subtitles of the film , using a spyglass identical to Klaus ' . The message instructs him to bring the children to Peru .

The next day , the Baudelaires discover Olaf standing next to Montgomery 's corpse . Olaf threatens to kill Sunny unless the siblings accompany him to Peru , but is prevented from carrying out his plan when Mr. Poe accidentally crashes into their car when they are trying to leave . Olaf 's theatre troupe then arrives disguised as police and nurses , and claim Monty was killed by the Incredibly Deadly Viper , despite Monty 's claim of it being completely harmless . While searching for proof of the snake 's innocence , Klaus discovers a statue in Monty 's hedge maze , and a photograph of Monty , both of them carrying spyglasses identical to Klaus ' . Violet proves Olaf to be the murderer ; however , he escapes via the hedge maze with Klaus ' spyglass . While pursuing him , the Baudelaires meet Jacquelyn , who is posing as a statue .

She refuses to answer questions about their parents , so the siblings pursue answers themselves around her house , and discover their parents were members of a secret organization , with spyglasses being used as useful devices . They are also shocked to find out that Josephine was once fierce and formidable , and developed her phobias after the death of her husband . Olaf , who has followed the Baudelaires , disguises himself as a sailor named Captain Sham before pretending to fall in love with Josephine . Despite the siblings ' warnings , Josephine accepts his invitation to take her out for a fried egg sandwich . Later that night , the siblings discover that Josephine has jumped out the library 's bay window and left a note informing them that `` Captain Sham '' is their new guardian . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 6 </Th> <Td> 6 </Td> <Td> `` The Wide Window : Part Two '' </Td> <Td> Barry Sonnenfeld </Td> <Td> Daniel Handler </Td> <Td> January 13 , 2017 ( 2017 - 01 - 13 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"6\"> As Mr. Poe prepares to hand the Baudelaires over to `` Captain Sham , '' the siblings discover the note has several grammatical errors , something Josephine would never do since she was obsessed with proper grammar . Mr. Poe takes the children to a restaurant and prepares to complete the transfer , but allows the siblings to leave after Larry , a waiter secretly a member of their parents ' organization , triggers their allergy to peppermint . After returning to the house , the siblings decipher Josephine 's suicide note and discover she is still alive moments before a hurricane sends the house teetering over the cliff . Escaping with a photograph of their parents standing in front of a lumber mill , the siblings find Josephine at a nearby cave , only to be confronted by Olaf , who abandons Josephine to be eaten alive by the leeches that inhabit Lake Lachrymose . Upon returning to shore , Olaf escapes after being unmasked in front of Mr. Poe while the Baudelaires sneak away and set out to find the lumber mill in the photograph . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 7 </Th> <Td> 7 </Td> <Td> `` The Miserable Mill : Part One '' </Td> <Td> Bo Welch </Td> <Td> Joe Tracz </Td> <Td> January 13 , 2017 ( 2017 - 01 - 13 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"6\"> Upon arriving at the Lucky Smells Lumber Mill , the Baudelaires are forced to work by the owner Sir , who blames their parents for starting a fire that destroyed the entire town .

Later that day , the siblings learn that two visitors are waiting to see them . Believing that their parents are still alive , the three are shocked to instead find Orwell and her receptionist `` Shirley St. Ives , '' who is a poorly - disguised Olaf .

The school 's only redeeming qualities are its friendly librarian , Olivia Caliban , and the surviving Quagmire triplets , Duncan and Isadora . During a lunch break , Klaus and Isadora discover that they are holding two halves of the same spyglass . The newfound friends quickly realize that they must track down a book on secret organizations to find the answers they seek -- a book Jacquelyn sent Larry to give them , but which he carelessly misplaced . Meanwhile , Count Olaf and his troupe lurk around the grounds of the school , unable to enter the front doors due to an advanced computer system programmed by Nero to detect Olaf 's presence . However , with Carmelita 's help , Olaf finally gains entry and locks Larry in the cafeteria 's walk - in refrigerator . He then dons his latest disguise : the school 's new turban - wearing gym teacher . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 10 </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` The Austere Academy : Part 2 '' </Td> <Td> Barry Sonnenfeld </Td> <Td> Joe Tracz </Td> <Td> March 30 , 2018 ( 2018 - 03 - 30 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"6\"> Olaf is able to convince Nero to put the Baudelaires under a grueling exercise program , making the siblings run endless laps at night to prevent them from scheming against him , while also causing them to perform poorly in class from lack of sleep . Due to their slumping grades , Nero threatens to expel the Baudelaires if they fail a comprehensive exam to be given in front of the entire school , but because they must still exercise under Olaf 's program , they know they will likely fail . The Quagmires offer to help , and that night take their place during exercises ; however , their identity is discovered , and while hiding in the library , they find the copy of the book on secret organizations and read up on the purpose of the spyglass before they are caught by the Hook - Handed Man . The next day , with Mr. Poe in attendance , the Baudelaires readily pass the exam , and through it reveal Olaf 's identity . Olaf and his gang then escape with the Quagmires , who try to shout the initials `` V.F.D. '' from the backseat of Olaf 's car . Meanwhile , Larry is rescued from the refrigerator with the help of Lemony 's brother , Jacques , while Olivia walks off with the book on secret organizations that the Quagmires left behind . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 11 </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` The Ersatz Elevator : Part 1 '' </Td> <Td> Bo Welch </Td> <Td> Daniel Handler </Td> <Td> March 30 , 2018 ( 2018 - 03 - 30 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"6\"> While a citywide manhunt for Count Olaf is underway , Mr. Poe takes the Baudelaires to the penthouse of Jerome Squalor and his trendy financial advisor wife Esmé . While being introduced to the Squalors , they find Olaf has already arrived , posing as a foreign auctioneer named Gunther . The Baudelaires theorize that Olaf is trying to kill Jerome so that he can marry Esmé and become their legal guardian again . They search the penthouse for the Quagmires to no avail , but Klaus becomes suspicious of an extra elevator that only seems to serve the penthouse . Meanwhile , Olivia tries to convince Mr. Poe about Olaf 's scheme , which leads Jacquelyn to contact Jacques , who enlists her into their society . Esmé suggests they go out for lunch at a fashionable salmon - themed restaurant Cafe Salmonella , where Larry works to prolong their visit , giving Jacques and Olivia time to search the Squalor 's building for the Quagmires . When the Baudelaires manage to sneak away and examine the second elevator , they learn that it is merely an empty shaft . With a makeshift parachute , they descend it to find the Quagmires locked in a cage at its bottom . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 12 </Th> <Td> </Td> <Td> `` The Ersatz Elevator : Part 2 '' </Td> <Td> Bo Welch </Td> <Td> Daniel Handler </Td> <Td> March 30 , 2018 ( 2018 - 03 - 30 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"6\"> The Baudelaires do not have the tools to free the Quagmires , so they ascend the shaft by turning the parachute into a hot - air balloon . They try to warn Esmé of Olaf 's scheme , but learn too late that she is in cahoots with him and that they are planning to smuggle the Quagmires out of the city . Esmé pushes them down the elevator shaft , where they are caught in a net midway down . Sunny helps them to escape safely , and afterwards they find a secret passage that leads to the ashen ruins of their home . At the auction in Veblen Hall , the Baudelaires start a bidding war on a box labeled `` V.F.D. '' , which they believe contains the Quagmires . Though they win the item , they find the box contains only doilies . In the aftermath , Olaf and his troupe escape with the Quagmires , who are hidden inside a red herring statue . The Baudelaires ask Jerome to help track down Olaf , but he is far too timid to do so , and gives up his guardianship of them . Mr. Poe tells the children that a village with the initials `` V.F.D.

The Baudelaires take up residence with Hector , a kindly handyman prone to fainting spells who is secretly building a self - sustaining hot - air mobile home , and soon begin finding clues written by the Quagmires themselves . Olaf , Esmé , and the troupe also arrive at the village , with Esmé disguising herself as the town 's new chief of police . Jacques and Olivia also arrive and detain Olaf at the local jailhouse ; the next day , the villagers learn of Olaf 's capture and hold a town hall meeting , where Olaf appears in the disguise of Detective Dupin , tricking everyone into believing Jacques is Olaf . Jacques is sentenced to death , but Olivia convinces Esmé to free her and Jacques in exchange for the location of the Sugar Bowl , an object with ties to Esmé 's past . Jacques stays behind to confront Olaf ; however , the villain is unfazed by Jacques ' offer of a truce , and he and Esmé incapacitate and kill him . The next morning , as the Baudelaires try to break into the jail to rescue Jacques , they are informed that `` Olaf '' has been murdered . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 14 </Th> <Td> 6 </Td> <Td> `` The Vile Village : Part 2 '' </Td> <Td> Barry Sonnenfeld </Td> <Td> Sigrid Gilmer </Td> <Td> March 30 , 2018 ( 2018 - 03 - 30 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"6\"> The disguised Olaf and Esmé quickly convince Mr. Poe and the town that the Baudelaires murdered Jacques / `` Olaf , '' and they are promptly condemned to be burned at the stake . While in jail , the children instruct Hector to prepare his hot - air mobile home to help them escape . While Violet creates a battering ram to weaken the jail wall , Klaus deduces from their clues that the Quagmires are hidden inside a crow fountain in the village square . Larry and Jacquelyn arrive on the scene to distract the villagers long enough for the children to escape via a fire truck and follow Hector . The Baudelaires cover for the Quagmires as they use the truck 's ladder to climb aboard the mobile home . As they do so , Olaf , Esmé , and the villagers arrive , and Esmé begins damaging Hector 's home with a harpoon gun . Realizing their danger , the Baudelaires tell Hector to escape with the Quagmires . In thanks , the Quagmires try to throw their friends their notes about the secrets of V.F.D. , but Esmé shoots them with a harpoon , scattering the pages and harming a crow . While the villagers accost the disguised villains over the injured bird , the Baudelaires collect as many of the ruined pages as they can and make their escape . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> 15 </Th> <Td> 7 </Td> <Td> `` The Hostile Hospital : Part 1 '' </Td> <Td> Alan Arkush </Td> <Td> Joshua Conkel </Td> <Td> March 30 , 2018 ( 2018 - 03 - 30 ) </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"6\"> The Baudelaires hitch a ride with volunteer singing candy stripers heading to Heimlich Hospital . They learn that there is a Library of Records that collects and stores esoterica . After sneaking past the hospital 's administrator Babs , they meet Hal , the man who runs the library . He welcomes their help , but forbids them to read material in storage . While Hal shows them the ropes , a film reel labeled `` Snicket '' arrives and catches the children 's attention . Meanwhile , believing the Sugar Bowl to be in the hospital , Olaf and his troupe infiltrate the building . Desperate for answers , the children are forced to steal Hal 's keys to access the library , where they find the film . It contains a debriefing of Jacques by a V.F.D. volunteer , with Jacques informing the interviewer that someone has survived a fire , which may or may not be the one that killed the Baudelaire 's parents . However , before they can watch any further , they are interrupted by Esmé ; as they try to escape , the library is ruined .

They eventually deduce which room Violet is in , but this is a trap laid by Olaf , who forces Klaus to operate on Violet inside an operating theater . Esmé promises to call off the scheme if Klaus can give her what he stole from the Library of Records , and he does so -- only , it 's not the Sugar Bowl that she has been searching for . Olaf , however , is interested in the Snicket film , and dashes off to watch it to learn its secret . Furious at its revelations , he burns the film , which also starts a fire in the hospital . The Baudelaires successfully evacuate the hospital and realize that their only chance to escape safely is in the trunk of Olaf 's car . Hal is left depressed over the loss of the Library of Records .

In the present , Olaf and his troupe arrive at the Caligari Carnival to speak with its fortune - teller , Madame Lulu , about the fire 's survivor . Lulu , who is really Olivia in disguise , tells them to wait for the answer in the morning . The Baudelaires overhear this , and hoping to speak to Lulu as well , assume the identities of circus freaks , with Violet and Klaus as a two - headed person and Sunny as a wolf child . After calling V.F.D. , Olivia is able to tell Olaf the next day that one of the Baudelaire parents did indeed survive the fire . Olaf then presents a freak show that proves disastrous , so he sets off to find a pack of roaming lions to help attract a larger crowd . This gives an opportunity for the children to sneak into Lulu 's tent , where they discover films , books , and disguises belonging to the Volunteer Fire Department -- the secret organization their parents and guardians belonged to .

While Olivia admits she had to lie to Olaf about one of the children 's parents surviving the fire , Jacques had asserted that there was a survivor , and they should head to the V.F.D. headquarters in the Mortmain Mountains to find them . Meanwhile , Olaf plans to throw one of the freaks into a pit filled with the hungry lions he has corralled , while Esmé connives to have Lulu killed . The next day , Olaf selects Violet and Klaus for the pit . When Olivia is told to push the children to the lions , she instead pushes them to safety , and is sent tumbling into the pit by Olaf for her troubles . As the children try to collect the V.F.D. materials from Lulu 's tent , Olaf arrives and forces them to burn the tent down . Then , after placing Violet and Klaus in a towed caravan and taking Sunny in his car , Olaf has the other freaks cut the towing rope on a steep mountain path . At the same time , the last operative to pose as Madame Lulu arrives at the burning carnival as Lemony Snicket claims that she is someone he knows . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H3> Season 3 ( edit ) </H3> <P> The third season will adapt the final four books of the novel series in seven episodes : The Slippery Slope , The Grim Grotto and The Penultimate Peril will be adapted into two episodes each , and The End will conclude the series with a longer single episode . Barry Sonnenfeld will direct the episodes for The Penultimate Peril . Liza Johnson and Jonathan Teplitzky will also direct episodes in the season . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Development ( edit ) </H3> <P> The thirteen A Series of Unfortunate Events novels , written by Daniel Handler under the pen name Lemony Snicket from 1999 to 2006 , achieved success in young adult fiction around the same time as the Harry Potter novels . As such , the Snicket books had been optioned to be filmed before they were published . This led to the development of a 2004 feature film , Lemony Snicket 's A Series of Unfortunate Events , which covered the narratives of the first three novels in the series . Barry Sonnenfeld , who has expressed his love for the series , was originally slated to direct the feature film , and had hired Handler to write the screenplay . About 10 months into production , shortly after the casting of Jim Carrey as Olaf , there was a `` big crisis '' , according to Handler , which caused producer Scott Rudin to walk away and Sonnenfeld left the production under unclear terms . With the film 's completion in flux , its producing studios Paramount Pictures and DreamWorks fired Handler . While the film was eventually completed and released , sequels which would adapt the other novels in the series became unlikely due to `` corporate shakeups '' within DreamWorks , according to Handler , and the child actors that portrayed the Baudelaire children grew too old to star in a sequel . </P> <P> In November 2014 , Netflix , in association with Paramount Television , announced its plans to adapt the novels into an original television series , with the author of the series , Daniel Handler , serving as executive producer . </P> <P> In September 2015 , it was announced that Barry Sonnenfeld and Mark Hudis had agreed to helm the series . Hudis would serve as showrunner , Sonnenfeld as director , and both as executive producers , with Handler writing some of the scripts along with working with the series ' writing team . However , in January 2016 , Netflix announced that Hudis had left the project , with a replacement showrunner not named at the time . </P> <P> The first season consists of eight episodes , with two episodes adapting each of the first four books of the series . Handler considered this more in line with how he had written the books in the manner of a serialized melodrama , citing The Perils of Pauline as one of his influences in writing the book series . In January 2017 , Handler revealed that he was writing the series ' second season , to consist of ten episodes adapting the fifth through ninth books of the series . A third season would adapt the remaining novels of the series , which Handler hoped `` to get the go - ahead to do '' since `` given how quickly young actors age and change , we 're trying to film everything as quickly as possible . '' In March 2017 , Netflix revealed the series had been renewed for a second season by releasing a video on their social media pointing to a viral marketing website , where a letter written by Snicket revealed the decision . A month later , the series was `` quietly '' renewed for a third season , which Harris confirmed would be the final one for the series . </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> Neil Patrick Harris portrays Count Olaf in the series and serves as a producer . <P> On December 3 , 2015 , an open casting call was announced for the roles of Violet and Klaus Baudelaire . In January 2016 , Netflix announced that Neil Patrick Harris had been cast as Count Olaf and Malina Weissman and Louis Hynes were cast as Violet and Klaus . Handler had first considered Harris for the role of Olaf after seeing him perform the opening number `` It 's Not Just for Gays Anymore '' , at the 65th Tony Awards in 2011 , noting `` I just immediately saw someone who could pull off a million things at once '' as was necessary for the character of Olaf , who utilizes various disguises and accents in his quest to steal the Baudelaire fortune . </P> <P> In March 2016 , K. Todd Freeman was cast as Mr. Poe , followed shortly after by the casting of Patrick Warburton as Lemony Snicket , and Aasif Mandvi as Uncle Monty . In September 2016 , it was revealed that Dylan Kingwell and Avi Lake were cast as the Quagmire siblings , Duncan and Isadora , respectively . In November 2016 , Handler revealed Catherine O'Hara , Don Johnson , and Alfre Woodard had been cast as Dr. Georgina Orwell , Sir , and Aunt Josephine , respectively ; O'Hara had previously portrayed Justice Strauss in the 2004 film adaptation of A Series of Unfortunate Events . It was also revealed that Presley Smith would play Sunny Baudelaire , whose quasi-nonsensical lines are voiced by Tara Strong , and Rhys Darby would play Charles , Sir 's partner . </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> <P> Production began in May 2016 in Vancouver , British Columbia , and in August 2016 several cast members expressed through social media that filming had finished . Filming for the second season began in April 2017 . The third season began filming on January 5 , 2018 . </P> <P> One aspect of the series of books that the production team wanted to be captured in the series was the notion of a lack of specific time period or geography for the settings ; Handler stated that he wrote enough for establishing set pieces , but purposely left more specific details vague `` in order for young readers to fill in the blanks themselves . '' Sonnenfeld wanted to capture that same sense of ambiguous time and place , and he and his team worked to try to define a set of subjective rules of what elements could be included . Sonnenfeld brought on Bo Welch , production designer for Edward Scissorhands , which Handler considered to capture the same sense of a `` familiar but completely imaginary '' suburban setting he had in mind for his books . While the production team used computer - generated imagery where needed , they attempted to avoid this use where possible , such as by using large painted backdrops , by key scenic artist John E. Wilcox , rather than employing green screen filming . </P> <H3> Music ( edit ) </H3> <P> In April 2016 , Nick Urata was initially reported to be composing music for the series . Once the first season was released , it was revealed that Urata collaborated with Daniel Handler to compose the main title theme , `` Look Away '' , as well as various original songs that appear throughout the series , with Handler contributing the lyrics . The first season 's original score was composed by James Newton Howard , with his frequent collaborators Sven Faulconer and Chris Bacon filling in to score certain episodes . In the second season , Jim Dooley joined the production as composer and subsequently wrote the music for all ten episodes . </P> <P> `` Look Away '' , the theme song for the opening titles of the series , is performed by Neil Patrick Harris . In keeping with the tone of the book series , the song warns the viewer against continuing to watch the unpleasant story any further . The lyrics of one verse of the song change for each pair of episodes , comprising a brief synopsis of those episodes ' premise . </P> <H3> Visual effects ( edit ) </H3> <P> Zoic Studios created visual effects for the series , including the effects for many of Sunny Baudelaire 's actions . Tippett Studio also did work on the series , including the effects for the destruction of Josephine 's house , landscape shots of Lake Lachrymose and some of the more movement heavy Sunny Baudelaire shots . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> All eight episodes of the first season of A Series of Unfortunate Events were released worldwide on Netflix on January 13 , 2017 , in Ultra HD 4K . The second season was released on March 30 , 2018 . </P> <H3> Marketing ( edit ) </H3> <P> On July 5 , 2015 a video titled `` An Unfortunate Teaser '' was uploaded to YouTube by a user named `` Eleanora Poe '' . Netflix quickly released a statement saying `` This was not released from Netflix . '' Media outlets were almost unanimous in agreement that the trailer was fan - made . However , Caitlin Petrakovitz of CNET argued that the trailer may be real and that Netflix 's carefully worded denial was a marketing campaign , noting the user name `` Eleanora Poe '' being the same as a character from the series , and that a vinyl record seen in the trailer was of The Gothic Archies , a band who provided the theme music for the audio books of A Series of Unfortunate Events . The trailer was later revealed to be a spec promo , similar to a spec script , by an independent commercial director , whom Netflix contracted to make a title sequence for the series after the video 's popularity , though they did not go ahead with the concept . </P> <P> In October 2016 , Netflix released the first teaser trailer for A Series of Unfortunate Events , where Warburton narrates the events of the series as Lemony Snicket . A trailer , featuring footage from the series and Neil Patrick Harris 's character , Count Olaf , was released by Netflix in November 2016 , followed shortly by the first full trailer . The second trailer was released in December 2016 , followed by a `` holiday - themed '' trailer from Count Olaf leading fans to a viral marketing website for the fictional Valorous Farms Dairy , which featured four holiday e-cards for download . </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Audience viewership ( edit ) </H3> <P> As Netflix does not reveal subscriber viewership numbers for any of their original series , Symphony Technology Group compiled data for the first season based on people using software on their devices that measure television viewing by detecting a program 's sound . According to Symphony , 3.755 million viewers age 18 - 49 were watching an episode of A Series of Unfortunate Events over the average minute in its first weekend of release . </P> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> Season 1 ( edit ) <P> The first season of A Series of Unfortunate Events received critical acclaim . Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the season an approval rating of 94 % based on 62 reviews , with an average rating of 8.1 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , `` Enjoyably dark , A Series of Unfortunate Events matches the source material 's narrative as well as its tone , leaving viewers with a wonderfully weird , dry , gothic comedy . '' On Metacritic the season has a score of 81 out of 100 , based on 23 critics , indicating `` universal acclaim '' . </P> <P> Erik Adams of The A.V. Club awarded the season a B and praised it for treating `` mature themes like grief , loss , and disappointment with sardonic honesty . '' Adams compared the program positively to the Adam West Batman series , calling it `` kids stuff with adult sophistication , driven by two - part stories , outrageous visuals , and the scenery - chewing of big - name guest stars '' . Ben Travers of Indiewire gave the series an A - , saying that it `` proves as inspirational and endearing as it claims to be forlorn and heartbreaking '' . Brian Lowry of CNN praised the showrunners for `` infusing the show with a lemony - fresh feel , conjuring a series similar to the fantastical tone of Pushing Daisies '' . Lowry wrote that `` the show proves a good deal of fun '' and that `` Harris dives into his over-the - top character with considerable gusto . '' He also argued that the series improved upon the 2004 film . </P> <P> Several critics praised the television series as a better adaptation of the books than the 2004 feature film , which starred Jim Carrey as Count Olaf . Kelly Lawler of USA Today felt the television format gave the stories more room to develop , the addition of Warburton as the fourth wall - breaking Snicket helped to convey some of the wordplay humor used in the books , and Harris 's portrayal of Olaf was `` much more dynamic , and creepier '' than Carrey 's version . The Verge 's Chaim Gartenburg said that the show follows the books much more faithfully than the film , and `` nails down the tone that made the stories so special '' . Los Angeles Times writer Robert Lloyd felt that the backgrounds of Sonnenfeld and Welch made them `` the right people for this job , set in a milieu that is hard to fix in time , except to say it is not now '' , in capturing the tones of the book compared to the feature film . </P> <P> Nick Allen of RogerEbert.com , on the other hand , gave the series a negative review , calling it `` an unfunny parody of sadness '' that is `` never as clever as it wants to be '' and would only appeal to fans of the books . Caroline Framke of Vox Media praised the series for its unique and weird visuals , but found the show 's tone , pacing and performances to be haphazard and considered the show to be `` literally , a series of unfortunate events '' . </P> Season 2 ( edit ) <P> As with the first season , the second season of A Series of Unfortunate Events received critical acclaim . Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the second season an approval rating of 100 % based on 13 reviews , with an average rating of 7.8 / 10 . Clarisse Loughrey of The Independent praised the show as one that `` essentially deals with thoughtful , intelligent young people battling to speak up against an illogical world . '' While observing that the `` show may revel in the miserable '' , she opined `` that the purpose of its own morbidity is to offer the assurance that hope lives in even the darkest of places . '' Loughrey also credited the show 's expanded storyline for the Baudelaires ' adult allies for `` plumping up '' the episodes ' narrative arcs and deepening the show 's emotional impact . </P> <P> Tristram Fane Saunders of The Telegraph awarded the second season four out of five stars . He described the show as a `` gothic treat ( that ) also offers a wicked line in absurdist humour , and the most gorgeously toybox - like set designs you 'll find anywhere outside a Wes Anderson film . '' Radio Times reviewer Huw Fullerton praised the series for its faithfulness to the original novels . While praising the improved CGI used to make Presley Smith 's character Sunny Baudelaire react better to situations , he criticized the addition of supporting `` good '' characters such as Nathan Fillion 's Jacques Snicket and Sara Canning 's Jacquelyn for `` undercutting the bleakness and loneliness that characterized the novels . '' </P> <P> Rohan Naahar of the Hindustan Times described A Series of Unfortunate Events as `` one of the most lavish originals in Netflix 's bottomless catalogue , created by fans , for fans . '' He also praised Neil Patrick Harris ' performance as Count Olaf . The Den of Geek reviewer Michael Ahr praised tortoise - shell ' amphibiophones ' and stone marimbas score for giving the television series its primal sound . IGN reviewer Jonathon Dornbush criticized the second season 's formulaic plot structure and lack of the insightful observations compared to the first season . He also praised several of the second season 's episodes particularly `` The Ersatz Elevator '' , `` The Hostile Hospital '' , and `` The Carnivorous Carnival '' for smartly twisting the story formula and deepening the novel series ' mythology . Dornbush also praised the performance of guest stars such as Lucy Punch and Patrick Warburton and awarded the second season 7.2 stars . </P> <H2> Awards and nominations ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Year </Th> <Th> Award </Th> <Th> Category </Th> <Th> Nominee </Th> <Th> Result </Th> <Th> Ref </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2017 </Td> <Td> Leo Awards </Td> <Td> Best Visual Effects in a Dramatic Series </Td> <Td> Luis Alejandro Guevara , Bob Habros , Cale Jacox , Ron Simonson , Jeffrey De Guzman </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Make - Up in a Dramatic Series </Td> <Td> Rita Ciccozzi , Krista Seller , Tanya Hudson , Gitte Axen </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Hairstyling in a Dramatic Series </Td> <Td> Julie Mchaffie , Dianne Holme , Jenine Lehfeldt </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Guest Performance by a Female in a Dramatic Series </Td> <Td> Sara Canning </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Saturn Awards </Td> <Td> Best New Media Television Series </Td> <Td> A Series of Unfortunate Events </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Creative Arts Emmy Awards </Td> <Td> Outstanding Music Composition for a Series </Td> <Td> James Newton Howard </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Gold Derby TV Awards </Td> <Td> Comedy Actor </Td> <Td> Neil Patrick Harris </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Hollywood Music in Media Awards </Td> <Td> Main Title Theme -- TV Show / Limited Series </Td> <Td> Nick Urata and Daniel Handler </Td> <Td> Won </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Peabody Awards </Td> <Td> Children 's & Youth Programming </Td> <Td> A Series of Unfortunate Events </Td> <Td> Won </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2018 </Td> <Td> Satellite Awards </Td> <Td> Best Actor in a Series - Comedy or Musical </Td> <Td> Neil Patrick Harris </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Netflix and critics name the first two episodes as `` The Bad Beginning '' , following the title of the book , while the episode itself displays the name of `` A Bad Beginning '' after the opening credits . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Netflix names the episodes of the second season as Part 1 and Part 2 , while the episodes themselves display the names as Part One and Part Two after the opening credits , following the format of the first season . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Netflix names the ninth and tenth episodes as `` Carnivorous Carnival '' , while the episodes themselves display the name of `` The Carnivorous Carnival '' after the opening credits , following the title of the book . </Li> </Ol> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Wollaston , Sam ( January 13 , 2017 ) . `` Lemony Snicket 's A Series of Unfortunate Events review -- fabulous steampunk fun '' -- via The Guardian . </Li> <Li> ^ Jump up to : `` A Series of Unfortunate Events ' : Barry Sonnenfeld Was Booted Off the Movie , and Now He 's Saved the Franchise '' .

When he refuses , she transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects , and erases the castle from the memories of their loved ones . She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the curse will never lift unless he learns to love another , and earn their love in return , before the last petal falls . </P> <P> Years later , in the village of Villeneuve , Belle dreams of adventure and brushes off advances from Gaston , an arrogant former soldier . Lost in the forest , Belle 's father Maurice seeks refuge in the Beast 's castle , but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose . Belle ventures out in search for him and finds him locked in the castle dungeon . The Beast agrees to let her take Maurice 's place . </P> <P> Belle befriends the castle 's servants , who treat her to a spectacular dinner . When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose , the Beast , enraged , scares her into the woods . She is cornered by wolves , but the Beast rescues her and is injured in the process . A friendship develops as Belle nurses his wounds . The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress , a book that transports readers wherever they want . Belle uses it to visit her childhood home in Paris , where she discovers a plague doctor mask . Belle realises that she and her father were forced to leave her mother 's deathbed as her mother succumbed to the plague . </P> <P> In Villeneuve , Gaston sees rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage and agrees to help Maurice . When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him , Gaston abandons him to the wolves . Maurice is rescued by the beggar Agathe , but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston 's crime , Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum . </P> <P> After sharing a romantic dance with the Beast , Belle discovers her father 's predicament using a magic mirror . The Beast releases her to save Maurice , giving her the mirror to remember him with . At Villeneuve , Belle proves Maurice 's sanity by revealing the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk . Realizing that Belle loves the Beast , Gaston has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father and rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast . Maurice and Belle escape and Belle rushes back to the castle . </P> <P> During the battle , Gaston abandons his companion LeFou , who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers . Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower , who is too depressed to fight back , but regains his will upon seeing Belle return . He overpowers Gaston but spares his life before reuniting with Belle . However , Gaston fatally shoots the Beast from a bridge , but it collapses when the castle crumbles and he falls to his death .

This character was cut from the film , but is featured in the deleted scenes . </P> <H2> Production ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Development ( edit ) </H3> <P> Previously , Disney had begun work on a film adaptation of the 1994 Broadway musical . However , in a 2011 interview , composer Alan Menken stated the planned film version of the Beauty and the Beast stage musical `` was canned '' . </P> <P> By April 2014 , Walt Disney Pictures had already begun developing a new live - action version and remake of Beauty and the Beast after making other live - action fantasy films such as Alice in Wonderland , Maleficent , Cinderella and The Jungle Book . In June 2014 , Bill Condon was signed to direct the film from a script by Evan Spiliotopoulos . Later in September of that same year , Stephen Chbosky ( who had previously directed Watson in The Perks of Being a Wallflower ) was hired to re-write the script . </P> <P> Before Condon was hired to direct the film , Disney approached him with a proposal to remake the film in a more radical way as Universal Studios had remade Snow White and the Huntsman ( 2012 ) . Condon later explained that `` after Frozen opened , the studio saw that there was this big international audience for an old - school - musical approach . But initially , they said , ' We 're interested in a musical to a degree , but only half full of songs . ' My interest was taking that film and doing it in this new medium -- live - action -- as a full - on musical movie . So I backed out for a minute , and they came back and said , ' No , no , no , we get it , let 's pursue it that way . ' '' Walt Disney Pictures president of production Sean Bailey credited Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn with the decision to make the film as a musical : `` We worked on this for five or six years , and for 18 months to two years , Beauty was a serious dramatic project , and the scripts were written to reflect that . It was n't a musical at that time . But we just could n't get it to click and it was Alan Horn who championed the idea of owning the Disney of it all . We realized there was a competitive advantage in the songs . What is wrong with making adults feel like kids again ? '' </P> <H3> Casting ( edit ) </H3> <P> In January 2015 , Emma Watson announced that she would be starring as Belle , the female lead . Watson was the first choice of Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan F. Horn , as he had previously overseen Warner Bros. which released the eight Harry Potter films that co-starred Watson as Hermione Granger . Two months later , Luke Evans and Dan Stevens were revealed to be in talks to play Gaston and the Beast respectively , and Watson confirmed their casting the following day through tweets . The rest of the principal cast , including Josh Gad , Emma Thompson , Kevin Kline , Audra McDonald , Ian McKellen , Gugu Mbatha - Raw , Ewan McGregor and Stanley Tucci were announced between March and April to play LeFou , Mrs. Potts , Maurice , Madame de Garderobe , Cogsworth , Plumette , Lumière and Cadenza , respectively . </P> <P> Susan Egan , who originated the role of Belle on Broadway , commented on the casting of Watson as `` perfect '' . Paige O'Hara , who voiced Belle in the original animated film and its sequels , offered to help Watson with her singing lessons . </P> <P> According to The Hollywood Reporter , Emma Watson was reportedly paid $3 million upfront , together with an agreement that her final take - home pay could rise as high as $15 million if the film generated gross box office income similar to Maleficent 's $759 million worldwide gross . </P> <H3> Filming ( edit ) </H3> <P> Principal photography on the film began at Shepperton Studios in Surrey , England , on May 18 , 2015 . Filming with the principal actors concluded on August 21 . Six days later , co-producer Jack Morrissey confirmed that the film had officially wrapped production . </P> <P> The Beast was portrayed with a `` more traditional motion capture puppeteering for the body and the physical orientation '' , where actor Dan Stevens was `` in a forty - pound gray suit on stilts for much of the film '' . The facial capture for the Beast was done separately in order to `` communicate the subtleties of the human face '' and `` ( capture the ) thought that occurs to him '' which gets `` through ( to ) the eyes , which are the last human element in the Beast . '' The castle servants who are transformed into household objects were created with CGI animation . </P> <P> Before the release of the film , Bill Condon refilmed one certain sequence in the `` Days of the Sun '' number , due to confusion among test audiences caused by actress Harriet Jones , who looked similar to Hattie Morahan , who portrayed Agathe . In the original version of the scene , it was Jones ' character , the Prince 's mother , who sings the first verse of the song , with Rudi Goodman playing the young Prince and Henry Garrett playing his father ; but in the reshot version of the scene , the singing part is given to the Prince ( now played by Adam Mitchell ) . The King was also recast to Tom Turner , although Harriet Jones was still the Queen , albeit with dark hair . Both Goodman and Garrett 's names were mistakenly featured in the original theatrical release 's credits , but was later corrected in home releases . </P> <H3> Music ( edit ) </H3> Main article : Beauty and the Beast ( 2017 soundtrack ) <P> When released in 1991 , Beauty and the Beast marked a turning point for Walt Disney Pictures by appealing to millions of fans with its Oscar - winning musical score by lyricist Howard Ashman and composer Alan Menken . In Bill Condon 's opinion , that original score was the key reason he agreed to direct a live - action version of the movie . `` That score had more to reveal '' , he says , `` You look at the songs and there 's not a clunker in the group . In fact , Frank Rich described it as the best Broadway musical of 1991 . The animated version was already darker and more modern than the previous Disney fairytales . Take that vision , put it into a new medium , make it a radical reinvention , something not just for the stage because it 's not just being literal , now other elements come into play . It 's not just having real actors do it '' . </P> <P> Condon initially prepared on only drawing inspiration from the original film , but he also planned to include most of the songs composed by Alan Menken , Howard Ashman and Tim Rice from the Broadway musical , with the intention of making the film as a `` straight - forward , live - action , large - budget movie musical '' . Menken returned to score the film 's music , which features songs from the original film by him and Howard Ashman , plus new material written by Menken and Tim Rice . Menken said the film will not include songs that were written for the Broadway musical and instead , created four new songs . However , an instrumental version of the song `` Home '' , which was written for the musical , is used during the scene where Belle first enters her room in the castle . </P> <P> On January 19 , 2017 , it was confirmed by both Disney and Céline Dion - singer of the original 1991 Beauty and the Beast duet song , with singer Peabo Bryson - that Dion would be performing one of the new original songs `` How Does a Moment Last Forever '' to play over the end titles . She originally had doubts about whether or not to record the song due to the recent death of her husband and manager René Angélil , who had previously helped her secure the 1991 pop duet . While ultimately accepting the opportunity , she said : `` ( The ) first Beauty and the Beast decision was made with my husband . Now I 'm making decisions on my own . It 's a little bit harder . I could n't say yes right away , because I felt like I was kind of cheating in a way ''. ( 18 ) She eventually felt compelled to record the song because of the impact Beauty and the Beast has had on her career . According to Dion , `` I was at the beginning of my career , it put me on the map , it put me where I am today ''. ( 9 ) Also , Josh Groban was announced to be performing the new original song `` Evermore '' on January 26 , 2017 . </P> <P> The 2017 film features a remake of the 1991 original song Beauty and the Beast recorded as a duet by Ariana Grande and John Legend . Grande and Legend 's updated version of the Beauty and the Beast title song is faithful to the original , Grammy - winning duet , performed by Céline Dion and Peabo Bryson for the 1991 Disney classic . </P> <P> Emma Thompson also performed a rendition of `` Beauty and the Beast '' , which was performed by Angela Lansbury in the original 1991 animated film release . </P> <P> Disney debuted the music video for Ariana Grande and John Legend 's interpretation of the title song `` Beauty and the Beast '' on Freeform television network on March 5 , 2017 , and it has since attained over 100 million video views on the Vevo video hosting service . </P> <H2> Release ( edit ) </H2> <P> On March 16 , 2015 , Disney announced the film would be released in 3D on March 17 , 2017 . The first official presentation of the film took place at Disney 's three - day D23 Expo in August 2015 . </P> <P> The world premiere of Beauty and the Beast took place on February 23 , 2017 , at Spencer House in London , England ; and the film later premiered at the El Capitan Theatre in Hollywood , California , on March 2 , 2017 . The stream was broadcast onto YouTube . </P> <P> A sing along version of the film released in over 1,200 US theaters nationwide on April 7 , 2017 . The United Kingdom received the same version on April 21 , 2017 . </P> <H3> Marketing ( edit ) </H3> <P> Disney spent around $140 million for marketing the film worldwide .

In its first 24 hours , the teaser trailer reached 91.8 million views , which topped the number of views seen in that amount of time in history , including for the teasers for other films distributed by Disney such as Avengers : Age of Ultron , Star Wars : The Force Awakens and Captain America : Civil War .

With a production budget of $160 million , it is the second-most expensive musical ever made ; only Hello , Dolly ! ( 1969 ) with a budget of $25 million ( $165 million in 2016 dollars ) cost more . In just ten days , it became the highest - grossing live - action musical of all time , beating the nine - year - old record held by Mamma Mia ! . It is currently the second biggest musical ever overall , behind Disney 's Frozen ( 2013 ) . Worldwide , the film proved to be a global phenomenon , earning a total of $357 million over its four - day opening weekend from 56 markets . Critics said the film was playing like superhero movies amongst women . It was the second biggest March global opening , behind only Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice , the thirteenth - biggest worldwide opening ever and the seventh - biggest for Disney . This includes $21 million from IMAX plays on 1,026 screens , a new record for an IMAX PG title . It surpassed the entire lifetime total of the original film in just six days . </P> <P> Beauty and the Beast is the 300th digitally remastered release in IMAX company 's history , which began with the re-release of Apollo 13 in 2002 . Its robust global debut helped push the company past $6 billion for the first time , and led to analysts believing that the film had a shot of passing $1 billion worldwide from theatrical earnings . On April 12 , it passed the $1 billion threshold , becoming the first film of 2017 , the fourteenth Disney film , and the twenty - ninth film overall to pass the mark . It became the first film since Rogue One ( also a Disney property ) in December 2016 to make over a billion dollars , and did so on its twenty - ninth day of release . It is currently the highest - grossing film of 2017 , the highest - grossing March release , the highest - grossing remake of all - time , and the fifth biggest Disney film .

Early tracking had the film grossing around $100 million in its opening weekend , with some publications predicting it could reach $130 million . By the time the film 's release was 10 days away , analysts raised projections to as high as $150 million . It earned $16.3 milion from Thursday previews night , marking the biggest of 2017 ( breaking Logan 's record ) , the biggest ever for a Disney live - action film ( breaking Maleficent 's record ) , the second biggest ever for both a G or PG - rated film ( behind the sixth Harry Potter film Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince which also starred Watson ) , and the third biggest ever in the month of March ( behind Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice and The Hunger Games ) . An estimated 41 % of the gross came from IMAX , 3D and premium large format screenings which began at 6 pm , while the rest -- 59 % -- came from regular 2D shows which began at 7 p.m. The numbers were considered more impressive given that the film played during a school week . </P> <P> On its opening day , the film made $63.8 million from 4,210 theaters across 9,200 screens , marking the third biggest in the month of March , trailing behind Batman v Superman ( $81.5 million ) and The Hunger Games ( $67 million ) . It was also the biggest opening day ever for a film that was n't PG - 13 , displacing the $58 million opening Wednesday of Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince . Its opening day alone ( which includes Thursday 's previews ) almost matched the entire opening weekend of previous Disney live - action films , Maleficent ( $69.4 million ) and Cinderella ( $67.9 million ) . Unlike all previous four Disney live - action films witnessing a hike on their second day , Saturday , Beauty and the Beast actually fell - 2 % , but nevertheless , the dip was paltry , and the grosses are so much bigger compared to the other titles . Earning a total of $174.8 million on its opening weekend , it defied all expectations and went on to set numerous notable records . This includes the biggest opening of the year as well as the biggest for the month of March and pre-summer / spring opening , beating Batman v Superman , the biggest start ever for a PG title ( also for a family film ) , surpassing Finding Dory , the biggest debut of all time for a female - fueled film , ahead of The Hunger Games : Catching Fire , the biggest for a Disney live - action adaptation , ahead of Alice in Wonderland and the biggest musical debut ever , supplanting Pitch Perfect 2 . Furthermore , it is also Watson 's highest - opening , beating Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 same with Emma Thompson , director Bill Condon 's biggest debut ever ahead of The Twilight Saga : Breaking Dawn -- Part 2 and the biggest outside of summer , save for Star Wars : The Force Awakens , not accounting for inflation . </P> <P> It became the forty - third film to debut with over $100 million and the fifteenth film to open above $150 million . Its three - day opening alone surpassed the entire original North American run of the first film ( $146 million ; before the 3D re-release ) , instantly becoming the second biggest film of the year , behind Logan ( $184 million ) , and also the second highest - grossing musical , behind Grease 's $188 million cumulative gross in 1978 . 70 % of the total ticket sales came from 2D showings signifying that people who do n't go to theaters frequently came out in bulk to watch the film . About 26 % of the remaining tickets were for 3D . IMAX accounted for 7 % ( $12.5 million ) of the total weekend 's gross , setting a new record for a PG title , ahead of Alice in Wonderland ( $12.1 million ) while PLF repped 11 % of the box office . 70 % of the film 's opening day demographic was female , dropping to 60 % through the weekend . According polling service PostTrak , about 84 percent of American parents who saw the film on its opening day said they would `` definitely '' recommend it for families . The film 's opening was credited to positive word of mouth from audiences , good reviews from critics , effective marketing which sold the title not just as a family film but also as a romantic drama , the cast 's star power ( especially Emma Watson ) , lack of competition , being the first family film since The Lego Batman Movie a month earlier , nostalgia , and the success and ubiquity of the first film and Disney 's brand . </P> <P> On Monday , its fourth day of release , the film fell precipitously by 72 % earning $13.5 million . The steep fall was due to a limited marketplace where only 11 % K - 12 and 15 % colleges were off per ComScore . Nevertheless , it is the second biggest March Monday , behind Batman v Superman ( $15 million ) . This was followed by the biggest March and pre-summer Tuesday with $17.8 million , a + 32 % increase from its previous day . The same day , the film passed $200 million in ticket sales . It earned $228.6 million in the first week of release , the sixth - biggest seven - day gross of all time . In its second weekend , the film continued to maintain the top positioning and fell gradually by 48 % earning another $90.4 million to register the fourth - biggest second weekend of all time , and the third - biggest for Disney . In terms of percentage drop , its 48 % decline is the third - smallest drop for any film opening above $125 million ( behind Finding Dory and The Force Awakens ) . The hold was notable considering how the film was able to fend off three new wide release ; Power Rangers , Life , and CHiPs . As a result , it passed the $300 million threshold becoming the first film of 2017 the pass said mark . The film grossed $45.4 million in its third weekend , finally being overtaken for the top spot by newcomer The Boss Baby ( $50.2 million ) . On April 4 , 2017 , its nineteenth day of release , it passed the $400 million threshold becoming the first film of 2017 to do so .

That weekend , The Circle was number four , while Beauty and the Beast was at number six . By May 28 , the film had earned over $500 million in ticket sales becoming the first ( and currently only ) film of 2017 , the third female - fueled film ( after The Force Awakens and Rogue One : A Star Wars Story followed by Wonder Woman ) and the eighth overall film in cinematic history to pass the mark . </P> <P> It has already become the biggest March release , dethroning The Hunger Games ( 2012 ) , the biggest musical film ( both animated and live - action ) , as well as the biggest film of 2017 . </P> Outside North America ( edit ) <P> Internationally , the film began playing on Thursday , March 16 , 2017 . Through Sunday , March 19 , it had a total international opening of $182.3 million from 55 markets , 44 of which were major territories , far exceeding initial estimations of $100 million and opened at No. 1 in virtually all markets except Vietnam , Turkey , and India .

It witnessed a decline in its second weekend , earning £ 12.33 million ( $15.4 million ) .

In India , despite facing heavy competitions from four new Hindi releases , two Tamils films and a Malayalam and a Punjabi release , the film managed to take an occupancy of 15 % on its opening day , an impressive feat despite tremendous competitions . It earned around ₹ 1.5 crore ( US $230,000 ) nett on its opening day from an estimated 600 screens which is more than the three Hindi releases -- Machine , Trapped and Aa Gaya Hero -- combined . Disney reported a total of ₹ 9.26 crore ( US $1.4 million ) gross for its opening weekend there . It was ahead of all new releases and second overall behind Bollywood film Badrinath Ki Dulhania . In Russia , despite receiving a restrictive 16 rating , the film managed to deliver a very successful opening with $6 million . </P> <P> In China , expectations were high for the film . The release date was announced on January 24 , giving Disney and local distributor China Film Group Corporation ample time -- around two months -- to market the film nationwide . The release date was strategically chosen to coincide with White Day . Preliminary reports suggested that it could open to $40 -- 60 million in its opening weekend . Largely driven by young women , its opening day pre-sales outpaced that of The Jungle Book . The original film was however never widely popular in the country . Although China has occasionally blocked gay - themed content from streaming video services , in this case , Chinese censors decided to leave the gay scene intact . According to local box office tracker Ent Group , the film grossed an estimated $12.1 million on its opening day ( Friday ) , representing 70 % of the total receipts . Including previews , it made a total of $14.5 million from 100,000 screenings , which is 43 % of all screenings in the country .

An estimated $1.1 million came from IMAX screenings , the fourth - biggest ever in the country . The two day gross was $9.7 million , outstripping Frozen 's previous record of $9.5 million . Due to positive reviews , good word - of - mouth and benefitting from the Golden Week , the film saw a 9 % increase on its second weekend . The hold was strong enough to fend off newcomer The Fate of the Furious from securing the top spot . The total there is now over $98 million after seven weekends and is the biggest film release of the year and overall the eleventh biggest of all time . It topped the box office there for eight consecutive weekends . </P> <P> The only markets where the film did not top the weekend charts were Vietnam ( behind Kong : Skull Island ) , Turkey ( with two local movies and Logan ahead ) and India ( where Badrinath Ki Dulhania retained No. 1 ) . It topped the box office for four straight weekends in Germany , Korea , Austria , Finland , Poland , Portugal , Brazil , Venezuela , Bolivia , Switzerland and the UK ( exclusive of previews ) . In the Philippines , it emerged as the most commercial successful film of all time -- both local and foreign -- with over $13.5 million . In just five weeks , the film became one of the top 10 highest - grossing film of all time in the United Kingdom and Ireland , ahead of all but one Harry Potter film ( Deathly Hallows -- Part 2 ) and all three The Lord of the Rings movies ( which also starred Ian McKellen ) . It is currently the eighth biggest grosser with £ 70.1 million ( $90 million ) , overtaking Mamma Mia ! to become the biggest musical production ever there . The biggest international earning markets following the UK are Japan ( $108 million ) , China ( $85.8 million ) , Brazil ( $41.5 million ) , Korea ( $37.5 million ) , and Australia ( $35 million ) . In Europe alone , the cumulative total is $267 million to become the second - highest - grossing film in the past 1 year ( behind Rogue One : A Star Wars Story ) . </P> <H3> Critical response ( edit ) </H3> <P> Beauty and the Beast received generally positive reviews , with praise for the faithfulness to the original film with a few elements of the Broadway musical version , cast performances , visuals , Jacqueline Durran 's costume designs , Alan Menken 's musical score and songs , though the designs of the Beast and the servants ' household object forms received mixed reviews . On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes , the film has an approval rating of 70 % based on 291 reviews , with an average rating of 6.6 / 10 . The site 's critical consensus reads , `` With an enchanting cast , beautifully crafted songs , and a painterly eye for detail , Beauty and the Beast offers a faithful yet fresh retelling that honors its beloved source material . '' On Metacritic , the film has a score of 65 out of 100 , based on 47 critics , indicating `` generally favorable reviews '' . In CinemaScore polls , audiences gave the film an average grade of `` A '' on an A+ to F scale . </P> <P> Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter wrote : `` It 's a Michelin - triple - starred master class in patisserie skills that transforms the cinematic equivalent of a sugar rush into a kind of crystal - meth - like narcotic high that lasts about two hours . '' Felperin also praised the performances of Watson and Kline as well the special effects , costume designs and the sets while commended the inclusion of Gad 's character of LeFou as the first LGBT character in Disney . Owen Gleiberman of Variety , in his positive review of the film , wrote : `` It 's a lovingly crafted movie , and in many ways a good one , but before that it 's an enraptured piece of old - is - new nostalgia . '' Gleiberman compared Steven 's character of the Beast to a royal version of the titular character in The Elephant Man and the 1946 version of the Beast in Jean Cocteau 's original adaptation . A.O. Scott of The New York Times praised the performances of both Watson and Stevens , and wrote : `` It looks good , moves gracefully and leaves a clean and invigorating aftertaste . I almost did n't recognize the flavor : I think the name for it is joy . '' Likewise , The Washington Post 's Ann Hornaday complimented Watson 's performance , describing it as `` alert and solemn '' while noting her singing ability as `` serviceable enough to get the job done '' . Richard Roeper of Chicago Sun - Times awarded the film three and a half stars , lauded the performances of Watson and Thompson which he drew a comparison to Paige O'Hara 's and Angela Lansbury 's performances in the 1991 animated version while appreciating the performances of the other cast and also pointing out on its usage of the combination of motion capture and CGI technology as a big advantage which he stated : `` Almost overwhelmingly lavish , beautifully staged and performed with exquisite timing and grace by the outstanding cast '' . Mike Ryan of Uproxx praised the cast , production design and the new songs while noting the film does n't try anything different , saying : `` There 's certainly nothing that new about this version of Beauty and the Beast ( well , except it is n't a cartoon anymore ) , but it 's a good recreation of a classic animated film that should leave most die - hards satisfied . '' In her A - review , Nancy Churnin of The Dallas Morning News praised the film 's emotional and thematic depth : `` There 's an emotional authenticity in director Bill Condon 's live - action Beauty and the Beast film that helps you rediscover Disney 's beloved 1991 animated film and 1994 stage show in fresh , stirring ways . '' </P> <P> Brian Truitt of USA Today commended the performances of Evans , Gad , McGregor and Thompson alongside Condon 's affinity with musicals , the production design , visual effects featured in some of the song numbers including new songs made by the composers Alan Menken and Tim Rice , particularly Evermore which he described the new song with a potential for an Academy Award for Best Original Song . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone rated the film three out of four stars which he deemed it as an `` exhilarating gift '' while he remarked that `` Beauty and the Beast does justice to Disney 's animated classic , even if some of the magic is M.I.A ( Missing in Action ) . '' Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine gave a positive review with a description as `` Wild , Vivid and Crazy - Beautiful '' as she wrote `` Nearly everything about Beauty and the Beast is larger than life , to the point that watching it can be a little overwhelming . '' and added that `` it 's loaded with feeling , almost like a brash interpretive dance expressing the passion and elation little girls ( and some boys , too ) must have felt upon seeing the earlier version . '' The San Francisco Chronicle 's Mick LaSalle struck an affirmative tone , calling it one of the joys of 2017 , stating that `` Beauty and the Beast creates an air of enchantment from its first moments , one that lingers and builds and takes on qualities of warmth and generosity as it goes along '' while referring the film as `` beautiful '' and also praised the film for its emotional and psychological tone as well Steven 's motion capture performance . Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph gave the film four stars out of five and wrote that `` It dazzles on this chocolate box of a picture that feels almost greedy yet to make this film work , down to a sugar - rush finale to grasp the nettle and make an out - an - out , bells - and - whistles musical '' while he praised the performances of Watson , McKellen , Thompson , McGregor , Evans and Gad . Mark Hughes of Forbes also similarly praised the film which he wrote that `` it could revive the story in a faithful but entirely new and unique way elevating the material beyond expectations , establishing itself as a cinematic equal to the original '' and also complimented the importance of undertaking a renowned yet problematic masterpiece as well addressing changes in the elements of the story while acknowledging the film 's effectiveness in resonating to the audiences . </P> <P> Several critics regarded the film as inferior to its 1991 animated predecessor . David Sims of The Atlantic wrote that the 2017 film `` feels particularly egregious , in part , because it 's so slavishly devoted to the original ; every time it falls short of its predecessor ( which is quite often ) , it 's hard not to notice '' . Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune said that the 2017 film `` takes our knowledge and our interest in the material for granted . It zips from one number to another , throwing a ton of frenetically edited eye candy at the screen , charmlessly . '' Phillips wrote that the film featured some `` less conspicuously talented '' performers who are `` stuck doing karaoke , or motion - capture work of middling quality '' , though he praised Kline 's performance as the `` best , sweetest thing in the movie ; he brings a sense of calm , droll authority '' . Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian praised Watson 's performance and wrote that the film was `` lit in that fascinatingly artificial honey - glow light , and it runs smoothly on rails -- the kind of rails that bring in and out the stage sets for the lucrative Broadway touring version . '' In the same newspaper , Wendy Ide criticized the film as `` ornate to the point of desperation '' in its attempt to emulate the animated film . </P> <P> Chris Nashawaty of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a B - , writing that while the film looks `` exceptionally great '' , he sensed that the new songs were `` not transporting '' . He felt the film needed more life and depth , but praised Watson 's and Steven 's performances as the `` film 's stronger elements '' . Dana Schwartz of the Observer felt that some of the characters , such as Gaston and the Beast , had been watered down from the 1991 film , and that the additional backstory elements failed to `` advance the plot or theme in any meaningful way '' while adding considerable bloat . Schwartz considered the singing of the cast to be adequate but felt that their voices should have been dubbed over , especially for the complex songs . </P> <H2> Accolades ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Award </Th> <Th> Date of ceremony </Th> <Th> Category </Th> <Th> Recipient ( s ) and nominee ( s ) </Th> <Th> Result </Th> <Th> Ref . </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> MTV Movie & TV Awards </Td> <Td> May 7 , 2017 </Td> <Td> Movie of the Year </Td> <Td> Beauty and the Beast </Td> <Td> Won </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Actor in a Movie </Td> <Td> Emma Watson </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Kiss </Td> <Td> Emma Watson and Dan Stevens </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Duo </Td> <Td> Josh Gad and Luke Evans </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Golden Trailer Awards </Td> <Td> June 6 , 2017 </Td> <Td> Best Animation / Family </Td> <Td> Beauty and the Beast </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Original Score </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Animation / Family TV Spot </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Best Fantasy Adventure TV Spot </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Teen Choice Awards </Td> <Td> August 13 , 2017 </Td> <Td> Choice Movie : Fantasy </Td> <Td> Won </Td> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Movie : Fantasy Actor </Td> <Td> Dan Stevens </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Movie : Fantasy Actress </Td> <Td> Emma Watson </Td> <Td> Won </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Movie Villain </Td> <Td> Luke Evans </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Movie Ship </Td> <Td> Emma Watson and Dan Stevens </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Liplock </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Scene Stealer </Td> <Td> Josh Gad </Td> <Td> Nominated </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Choice Hissy Fit </Td> <Td> Luke Evans </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Dan Stevens </Td> </Tr> </Table> <H2> Controversies ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Gay character ( edit ) </H3> <P> Controversy erupted after director Bill Condon said there was a `` gay moment '' in the film , when LeFou briefly waltzes with Stanley , one of Gaston 's friends . Afterwards in an interview with Vulture.com , Condon stated , `` Can I just say , I 'm sort of sick of this . Because you 've seen the movie -- it 's such a tiny thing , and it 's been overblown . '' Condon also added that Beauty and the Beast features much more diversity than just the highly - talked - about LeFou : `` That was so important . We have interracial couples -- this is a celebration of everybody 's individuality , and that 's what 's exciting about it . '' GLAAD president and CEO Sarah Kate Ellis praised the move stating , `` It is a small moment in the film , but it is a huge leap forward for the film industry . '' </P> <P> In Russia , Vitaly Milonov agitated the culture minister for banning the film , but instead it was given a 16 + rating ( children under the age of 16 can only be admitted to see it in theaters with accompanying adults ) . Additionally , a theater in Henagar , Alabama did not screen the film because of the subplot . In Malaysia , the Film Censorship Board insisted the `` gay moment '' scene be cut , prompting an indefinite postponement of its release by Disney , followed by their decision to withdraw it completely if it could not be released uncensored . The studio moved the release date to March 30 , to allow more time for Malaysia 's censor board to make a decision on whether or not to release the film without changes . The distributors and producers then submitted an appeal to the Film Appeal Committee of Malaysia , which allowed the film to be released without any cuts and a P13 rating on the grounds that the `` gay element '' was minor and did not affect the positive elements featured in the film . In Kuwait , the movie was withdrawn from cinemas by National Cinema Company which owns most of the cinemas in the country . A board member of the company stated that the Ministry of Information 's censorship department had requested it to stop its screening and edit it for things deemed offensive by it . </P> <P> There were also a number of boycotts against the film . A call to boycott on LifePetitions received over 129,000 signatures , while the American Family Association featured a petition to boycott with the film , asking the public to help crowdfund a CGI version of Pilgrim 's Progress instead . </P> <H3> Belle and the Beast 's relationship ( edit ) </H3> <P> Disney has sought to portray Belle as an empowered young woman , but a debate questioning whether it is possible to fall in love with someone who is holding you prisoner , and whether this is a problematic theme , has resulted . As was the case with the original animated film , one argument is that Belle suffers from Stockholm syndrome ( a condition that causes hostages to develop a psychological alliance with their captors as a survival strategy during captivity ) . Emma Watson studied whether Belle is trapped in an abusive relationship with the Beast before signing on and concluded that she does not think the criticism fits this version of the folk tale . Watson described Stockholm Syndrome as `` where a prisoner will take on the characteristics of and fall in love with the captor . Belle actively argues and disagrees with ( Beast ) constantly . She has none of the characteristics of someone with Stockholm Syndrome because she keeps her independence , she keeps that freedom of thought '' , also adding that Belle defiantly `` gives as good as she gets '' before forming a friendship and romance with the Beast . </P> <P> Psychiatrist Frank Ochberg , who coined the term `` Stockholm syndrome '' , said he does not think Belle exhibits the trauma symptoms of prisoners suffering from the syndrome because she does not go through a period of feeling that she is going to die . Some therapists , while acknowledging that the pairing 's relationship does not meet the clinical definition of Stockholm syndrome , argue that the relationship depicted is dysfunctional and abusive and does not model healthy romantic relationships for young viewers . Constance Grady of Vox writes that Jeanne - Marie Leprince de Beaumont 's Beauty and the Beast was a fairy tale originally written to prepare young girls in 18th century France for arranged marriages , and that the power disparity is amplified in the Disney version . Anna Menta of Elite Daily argued that the Beast does not apologize to Belle for imprisoning , hurting , or manipulating her , and his treatment of Belle is not painted as wrong . </P> <H2> Notes ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> ^ Jump up to : Beauty and the Beast at Box Office Mojo .

The reactions involved in respiration are catabolic reactions , which break large molecules into smaller ones , releasing energy in the process , as weak so - called `` high - energy '' bonds are replaced by stronger bonds in the products . Respiration is one of the key ways a cell releases chemical energy to fuel cellular activity . Cellular respiration is considered an exothermic redox reaction which releases heat . The overall reaction occurs in a series of biochemical steps , most of which are redox reactions themselves . Although cellular respiration is technically a combustion reaction , it clearly does not resemble one when it occurs in a living cell because of the slow release of energy from the series of reactions . </P> <P> Nutrients that are commonly used by animal and plant cells in respiration include sugar , amino acids and fatty acids , and the most common oxidizing agent ( electron acceptor ) is molecular oxygen ( O ) . The chemical energy stored in ATP ( its third phosphate group is weakly bonded to the rest of the molecule and is cheaply broken allowing stronger bonds to form , thereby transferring energy for use by the cell ) can then be used to drive processes requiring energy , including biosynthesis , locomotion or transportation of molecules across cell membranes . </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Aerobic respiration <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Aerobic respiration summed up </Li> <Li> 1.2 Glycolysis </Li> <Li> 1.3 Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate </Li> <Li> 1.4 Citric acid cycle </Li> <Li> 1.5 Oxidative phosphorylation </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 Efficiency of ATP production </Li> <Li> 3 Fermentation </Li> <Li> 4 Anaerobic respiration </Li> <Li> 5 See also </Li> <Li> 6 References </Li> <Li> 7 External links </Li> </Ul> <H2> Aerobic respiration </H2> Aerobic respiration ( red arrows ) is the main means by which both fungi and animals utilize chemical energy in the form of organic compounds that were previously created through photosynthesis ( green arrow ) . <P> Aerobic respiration requires oxygen ( O ) in order to create ATP . Although carbohydrates , fats , and proteins are consumed as reactants , it is the preferred method of pyruvate breakdown in glycolysis and requires that pyruvate enter the mitochondria in order to be fully oxidized by the Krebs cycle . The products of this process are carbon dioxide and water , but the energy transferred is used to break bonds in ADP as the third phosphate group is added to form ATP ( adenosine triphosphate ) , by substrate - level phosphorylation , NADH and FADH </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> Simplified reaction : </Td> <Td> C H O ( s ) + 6 O ( g ) → 6 CO ( g ) + 6 H O ( l ) + heat </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> ΔG = − 2880 kJ per mol of C H O </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The negative ΔG indicates that the reaction can occur spontaneously . </P> <P> The potential of NADH and FADH is converted to more ATP through an electron transport chain with oxygen as the `` terminal electron acceptor '' . Most of the ATP produced by aerobic cellular respiration is made by oxidative phosphorylation . This works by the energy released in the consumption of pyruvate being used to create a chemiosmotic potential by pumping protons across a membrane . This potential is then used to drive ATP synthase and produce ATP from ADP and a phosphate group . Biology textbooks often state that 38 ATP molecules can be made per oxidised glucose molecule during cellular respiration ( 2 from glycolysis , 2 from the Krebs cycle , and about 34 from the electron transport system ) . However , this maximum yield is never quite reached because of losses due to leaky membranes as well as the cost of moving pyruvate and ADP into the mitochondrial matrix , and current estimates range around 29 to 30 ATP per glucose . </P> <P> Aerobic metabolism is up to 15 times more efficient than anaerobic metabolism ( which yields 2 molecules ATP per 1 molecule glucose ) . However some anaerobic organisms , such as methanogens are able to continue with anaerobic respiration , yielding more ATP by using other inorganic molecules ( not oxygen ) as final electron acceptors in the electron transport chain . They share the initial pathway of glycolysis but aerobic metabolism continues with the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation . The post-glycolytic reactions take place in the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells , and in the cytoplasm in prokaryotic cells . </P> <H3> Aerobic respiration summed up </H3> <P> 1 .

It then mixes with CO and makes 2 ATP , NADH , and FADH . From there the NADH and FADH go into the NADH reductase , which produces the enzyme . The NADH pulls the enzyme 's electrons to send through the electron transport chain . The electron transport chain pulls H ions through the chain . From the electron transport chain , the released hydrogen ions make ADP for an end result of 32 ATP . O attracts itself to the left over electron to make water . Lastly , ATP leaves through the ATP channel and out of the mitochondria . Main article : Glycolysis <P> Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway that takes place in the cytosol of cells in all living organisms . This pathway can function with or without the presence of oxygen . In humans , aerobic conditions produce pyruvate and anaerobic conditions produce lactate . In aerobic conditions , the process converts one molecule of glucose into two molecules of pyruvate ( pyruvic acid ) , generating energy in the form of two net molecules of ATP . Four molecules of ATP per glucose are actually produced , however , two are consumed as part of the preparatory phase . The initial phosphorylation of glucose is required to increase the reactivity ( decrease its stability ) in order for the molecule to be cleaved into two pyruvate molecules by the enzyme aldolase . During the pay - off phase of glycolysis , four phosphate groups are transferred to ADP by substrate - level phosphorylation to make four ATP , and two NADH are produced when the pyruvate are oxidized . The overall reaction can be expressed this way : </P> <Dl> <Dd> Glucose + 2 NAD + 2 P + 2 ADP → 2 pyruvate + 2 NADH + 2 ATP + 2 H + 2 H O + heat </Dd> </Dl> <P> Starting with glucose , 1 ATP is used to donate a phosphate to glucose to produce glucose 6 - phosphate . Glycogen can be converted into glucose 6 - phosphate as well with the help of glycogen phosphorylase . During energy metabolism , glucose 6 - phosphate becomes fructose 6 - phosphate . An additional ATP is used to phosphorylate fructose 6 - phosphate into fructose 1 , 6 - disphosphate by the help of phosphofructokinase . Fructose 1 , 6 - diphosphate then splits into two phosphorylated molecules with three carbon chains which later degrades into pyruvate . </P> <P> Glycolysis can be literally translated as `` sugar splitting '' . </P> <H3> Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate </H3> Main article : Pyruvate decarboxylation <P> Pyruvate is oxidized to acetyl - CoA and CO by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex ( PDC ) . The PDC contains multiple copies of three enzymes and is located in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and in the cytosol of prokaryotes . In the conversion of pyruvate to acetyl - CoA , one molecule of NADH and one molecule of CO is formed . </P> <H3> Citric acid cycle </H3> Main article : Citric acid cycle <P> This is also called the Krebs cycle or the tricarboxylic acid cycle . When oxygen is present , acetyl - CoA is produced from the pyruvate molecules created from glycolysis . Once acetyl - CoA is formed , aerobic or anaerobic respiration can occur . When oxygen is present , the mitochondria will undergo aerobic respiration which leads to the Krebs cycle . However , if oxygen is not present , fermentation of the pyruvate molecule will occur . In the presence of oxygen , when acetyl - CoA is produced , the molecule then enters the citric acid cycle ( Krebs cycle ) inside the mitochondrial matrix , and is oxidized to CO while at the same time reducing NAD to NADH . NADH can be used by the electron transport chain to create further ATP as part of oxidative phosphorylation . To fully oxidize the equivalent of one glucose molecule , two acetyl - CoA must be metabolized by the Krebs cycle . Two waste products , H O and CO , are created during this cycle . </P> <P> The citric acid cycle is an 8 - step process involving 18 different enzymes and co-enzymes . During the cycle , acetyl - CoA ( 2 carbons ) + oxaloacetate ( 4 carbons ) yields citrate ( 6 carbons ) , which is rearranged to a more reactive form called isocitrate ( 6 carbons ) . Isocitrate is modified to become α - ketoglutarate ( 5 carbons ) , succinyl - CoA , succinate , fumarate , malate , and , finally , oxaloacetate . </P> <P> The net gain of high - energy compounds from one cycle is 3 NADH , 1 FADH , and 1 GTP ; the GTP may subsequently be used to produce ATP . Thus , the total yield from 1 glucose molecule ( 2 pyruvate molecules ) is 6 NADH , 2 FADH , and 2 ATP . </P> <H3> Oxidative phosphorylation </H3> Main articles : Oxidative phosphorylation , Electron transport chain , Electrochemical gradient , and ATP synthase <P> In eukaryotes , oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the mitochondrial cristae . It comprises the electron transport chain that establishes a proton gradient ( chemiosmotic potential ) across the boundary of inner membrane by oxidizing the NADH produced from the Krebs cycle . ATP is synthesized by the ATP synthase enzyme when the chemiosmotic gradient is used to drive the phosphorylation of ADP . The electrons are finally transferred to exogenous oxygen and , with the addition of two protons , water is formed . </P> <H2> Efficiency of ATP production </H2> <P> The table below describes the reactions involved when one glucose molecule is fully oxidized into carbon dioxide . It is assumed that all the reduced coenzymes are oxidized by the electron transport chain and used for oxidative phosphorylation . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Step </Th> <Th> coenzyme yield </Th> <Th> ATP yield </Th> <Th> Source of ATP </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Glycolysis preparatory phase </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> − 2 </Td> <Td> Phosphorylation of glucose and fructose 6 - phosphate uses two ATP from the cytoplasm . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Glycolysis pay - off phase </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Substrate - level phosphorylation </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2 NADH </Td> <Td> 3 or 5 </Td> <Td> Oxidative phosphorylation : Each NADH produces net 1.5 ATP ( instead of usual 2.5 ) due to NADH transport over the mitochondrial membrane </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate </Td> <Td> 2 NADH </Td> <Td> 5 </Td> <Td> Oxidative phosphorylation </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Krebs cycle </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Substrate - level phosphorylation </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6 NADH </Td> <Td> 15 </Td> <Td> Oxidative phosphorylation </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 2 FADH </Td> <Td> </Td> <Td> Oxidative phosphorylation </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td_colspan=\"2\"> Total yield </Td> <Td> 30 or 32 ATP </Td> <Td> From the complete oxidation of one glucose molecule to carbon dioxide and oxidation of all the reduced coenzymes . </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Although there is a theoretical yield of 38 ATP molecules per glucose during cellular respiration , such conditions are generally not realized because of losses such as the cost of moving pyruvate ( from glycolysis ) , phosphate , and ADP ( substrates for ATP synthesis ) into the mitochondria . All are actively transported using carriers that utilize the stored energy in the proton electrochemical gradient . </P> <Ul> <Li> Pyruvate is taken up by a specific , low Km transporter to bring it into the mitochondrial matrix for oxidation by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex . </Li> <Li> The phosphate carrier ( PiC ) mediates the electroneutral exchange ( antiport ) of phosphate ( H PO ; P ) for OH or symport of phosphate and protons ( H ) across the inner membrane , and the driving force for moving phosphate ions into the mitochondria is the proton motive force . </Li> <Li> The ATP - ADP translocase ( also called adenine nucleotide translocase , ANT ) is an antiporter and exchanges ADP and ATP across the inner membrane . The driving force is due to the ATP ( − 4 ) having a more negative charge than the ADP ( − 3 ) , and thus it dissipates some of the electrical component of the proton electrochemical gradient . </Li> </Ul> <P> The outcome of these transport processes using the proton electrochemical gradient is that more than 3 H are needed to make 1 ATP . Obviously this reduces the theoretical efficiency of the whole process and the likely maximum is closer to 28 -- 30 ATP molecules . In practice the efficiency may be even lower because the inner membrane of the mitochondria is slightly leaky to protons . Other factors may also dissipate the proton gradient creating an apparently leaky mitochondria . An uncoupling protein known as thermogenin is expressed in some cell types and is a channel that can transport protons . When this protein is active in the inner membrane it short circuits the coupling between the electron transport chain and ATP synthesis . The potential energy from the proton gradient is not used to make ATP but generates heat . This is particularly important in brown fat thermogenesis of newborn and hibernating mammals . </P> Stoichiometry of aerobic respiration and most known fermentation types in eucaryotic cell . Numbers in circles indicate counts of carbon atoms in molecules , C6 is glucose C H O , C1 carbon dioxide CO . Mitochondrial outer membrane is omitted . <P> According to some of newer sources the ATP yield during aerobic respiration is not 36 -- 38 , but only about 30 -- 32 ATP molecules / 1 molecule of glucose , because : </P> <Ul> <Li> ATP : NADH + H and ATP : FADH ratios during the oxidative phosphorylation appear to be not 3 and 2 , but 2.5 and 1.5 respectively . Unlike in the substrate - level phosphorylation , the stoichiometry here is difficult to establish . <Ul> <Li> ATP synthase produces 1 ATP / 3 H. However the exchange of matrix ATP for cytosolic ADP and Pi ( antiport with OH or symport with H ) mediated by ATP -- ADP translocase and phosphate carrier consumes 1 H / 1 ATP as a result of regeneration of the transmembrane potential changed during this transfer , so the net ratio is 1 ATP : 4 H . </Li> <Li> The mitochondrial electron transport chain proton pump transfers across the inner membrane 10 H / 1 NADH + H ( 4 + 2 + 4 ) or 6 H / 1 FADH ( 2 + 4 ) . </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <Dl> <Dd> So the final stoichiometry is </Dd> <Dd> 1 NADH + H : 10 H : 10 / 4 ATP = 1 NADH + H : 2.5 ATP </Dd> <Dd> 1 FADH : 6 H : 6 / 4 ATP = 1 FADH : 1.5 ATP </Dd> </Dl> <Ul> <Li> ATP : NADH + H coming from glycolysis ratio during the oxidative phosphorylation is <Ul> <Li> 1.5 , as for FADH , if hydrogen atoms ( 2H + 2e ) are transferred from cytosolic NADH + H to mitochondrial FAD by the glycerol phosphate shuttle located in the inner mitochondrial membrane . </Li> <Li> 2.5 in case of malate - aspartate shuttle transferring hydrogen atoms from cytosolic NADH + H to mitochondrial NAD </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> So finally we have , per molecule of glucose </P> <Ul> <Li> Substrate - level phosphorylation : 2 ATP from glycolysis + 2 ATP ( directly GTP ) from Krebs cycle </Li> <Li> Oxidative phosphorylation <Ul> <Li> 2 NADH + H from glycolysis : 2 × 1.5 ATP ( if glycerol phosphate shuttle transfers hydrogen atoms ) or 2 × 2.5 ATP ( malate - aspartate shuttle ) </Li> <Li> 2 NADH + H from the oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate and 6 from Krebs cycle : 8 × 2.5 ATP </Li> <Li> 2 FADH from the Krebs cycle : 2 × 1.5 ATP </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <P> Altogether this gives 4 + 3 ( or 5 ) + 20 + 3 = 30 ( or 32 ) ATP per molecule of glucose </P> <P> The total ATP yield in ethanol or lactic acid fermentation is only 2 molecules coming from glycolysis , because pyruvate is not transferred to the mitochondrion and finally oxidized to the carbon dioxide ( CO ) , but reduced to ethanol or lactic acid in the cytoplasm . </P> <H2> Fermentation </H2> Main article : Fermentation <P> Without oxygen , pyruvate ( pyruvic acid ) is not metabolized by cellular respiration but undergoes a process of fermentation . The pyruvate is not transported into the mitochondrion , but remains in the cytoplasm , where it is converted to waste products that may be removed from the cell . This serves the purpose of oxidizing the electron carriers so that they can perform glycolysis again and removing the excess pyruvate . Fermentation oxidizes NADH to NAD+ so it can be re-used in glycolysis . In the absence of oxygen , fermentation prevents the buildup of NADH in the cytoplasm and provides NAD+ for glycolysis . This waste product varies depending on the organism . In skeletal muscles , the waste product is lactic acid . This type of fermentation is called lactic acid fermentation . In strenuous exercise , when energy demands exceed energy supply , the respiratory chain can not process all of the hydrogen atoms joined by NADH . During anaerobic glycolysis , NAD+ regenerates when pairs of hydrogen combine with pyruvate to form lactate . Lactate formation is catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase in a reversible reaction . Lactate can also be used as an indirect precursor for liver glycogen . During recovery , when oxygen becomes available , NAD+ attaches to hydrogen from lactate to form ATP . In yeast , the waste products are ethanol and carbon dioxide . This type of fermentation is known as alcoholic or ethanol fermentation . The ATP generated in this process is made by substrate - level phosphorylation , which does not require oxygen . </P> <P> Fermentation is less efficient at using the energy from glucose : only 2 ATP are produced per glucose , compared to the 38 ATP per glucose nominally produced by aerobic respiration . This is because the waste products of fermentation still contain chemical potential energy that can be released by oxidation . Ethanol , for example , can be burned in an internal combustion engine like gasoline . Glycolytic ATP , however , is created more quickly . For prokaryotes to continue a rapid growth rate when they are shifted from an aerobic environment to an anaerobic environment , they must increase the rate of the glycolytic reactions . For multicellular organisms , during short bursts of strenuous activity , muscle cells use fermentation to supplement the ATP production from the slower aerobic respiration , so fermentation may be used by a cell even before the oxygen levels are depleted , as is the case in sports that do not require athletes to pace themselves , such as sprinting . </P> <H2> Anaerobic respiration </H2> Main article : Anaerobic respiration <P> Cellular respiration is the process by which biological fuels are oxidised in the presence of an inorganic electron acceptor ( such as oxygen ) to produce large amounts of energy , to drive the bulk production of ATP . </P> <P> Anaerobic respiration is used by some microorganisms in which neither oxygen ( aerobic respiration ) nor pyruvate derivatives ( fermentation ) is the final electron acceptor . Rather , an inorganic acceptor such as sulfate or nitrate is used . Such organisms are typically found in unusual places such as underwater caves or near hydrothermal vents at the bottom of the ocean . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> Maintenance respiration : maintenance as a functional component of cellular respiration </Li> <Li> Pasteur point </Li> <Li> Respirometry : research tool to explore cellular respiration </Li> <Li> Tetrazolium chloride : cellular respiration indicator </Li> <Li> Complex 1 : NADH : ubiquinone oxidoreductes </Li> </Ul> <H2> References </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Bailey , Regina . `` Cellular Respiration '' .

It pitted the colonies of British America against those of New France . Both sides were supported by military units from their parent countries of Great Britain and France , as well as by American Indian allies . At the start of the war , the French North American colonies had a population of roughly 60,000 settlers , compared with 2 million in the British North American colonies . The outnumbered French particularly depended on the Indians . The European nations declared war on one another in 1756 following months of localized conflict , escalating the war from a regional affair into an intercontinental conflict . </P> <P> The name French and Indian War is used mainly in the United States . It refers to the two main enemies of the British colonists : the royal French forces and the various American Indian forces allied with them . The British colonists were supported at various times by the Iroquois , Catawba , and Cherokee , and the French colonists were supported by Wabanaki Confederacy members Abenaki and Mi'kmaq , and Algonquin , Lenape , Ojibwa , Ottawa , Shawnee , and Wyandot . </P> <P> British and other European historians use the term the Seven Years ' War , as do English - speaking Canadians . French Canadians call it La guerre de la Conquête ( the War of the Conquest ) or ( rarely ) the Fourth Intercolonial War . </P> <P> Fighting took place primarily along the frontiers between New France and the British colonies , from Virginia in the south to Newfoundland in the north . It began with a dispute over control of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers called the Forks of the Ohio , and the site of the French Fort Duquesne within present - day Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . The dispute erupted into violence in the Battle of Jumonville Glen in May 1754 , during which Virginia militiamen under the command of 22 - year - old George Washington ambushed a French patrol . </P> <P> In 1755 , six colonial governors in North America met with General Edward Braddock , the newly arrived British Army commander , and planned a four - way attack on the French . None succeeded , and the main effort by Braddock proved a disaster ; he lost the Battle of the Monongahela on July 9 , 1755 and died a few days later . British operations failed in the frontier areas of Pennsylvania and New York during 1755 - 57 due to a combination of poor management , internal divisions , effective Canadian scouts , French regular forces , and Indian warrior allies . In 1755 , the British captured Fort Beauséjour on the border separating Nova Scotia from Acadia , and they ordered the expulsion of the Acadians ( 1755 -- 64 ) soon afterwards . Orders for the deportation were given by William Shirley , Commander - in - Chief , North America , without direction from Great Britain . The Acadians were expelled , both those captured in arms and those who had sworn the loyalty oath to His Britannic Majesty . Indians likewise were driven off the land to make way for settlers from New England . </P> <P> The British colonial government fell in the region of modern Nova Scotia after several disastrous campaigns in 1757 , including a failed expedition against Louisbourg and the Siege of Fort William Henry ; this last was followed by Indians torturing and massacring their British victims . William Pitt came to power and significantly increased British military resources in the colonies at a time when France was unwilling to risk large convoys to aid the limited forces that they had in New France , preferring to concentrate their forces against Prussia and its allies in the European theater of the war . Between 1758 and 1760 , the British military launched a campaign to capture the Colony of Canada ( part of New France ) . They succeeded in capturing territory in surrounding colonies and ultimately the city of Quebec ( 1759 ) . The British later lost the Battle of Sainte - Foy west of Quebec ( 1760 ) , but the French ceded Canada in accordance with the Treaty of Paris ( 1763 ) . </P> <P> The outcome was one of the most significant developments in a century of Anglo - French conflict . France ceded to Great Britain its territory east of the Mississippi . It ceded French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River ( including New Orleans ) to its ally Spain in compensation for Spain 's loss to Britain of Florida . ( Spain had ceded Florida to Britain in exchange for the return of Havana , Cuba . ) France 's colonial presence north of the Caribbean was reduced to the islands of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , confirming Great Britain 's position as the dominant colonial power in eastern North America . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 The origin of the name </Li> <Li> 2 North America in the 1750s </Li> <Li> 3 Events leading to war <Ul> <Li> 3.1 Céloron 's expedition </Li> <Li> 3.2 Negotiations </Li> <Li> 3.3 Attack on Pickawillany </Li> <Li> 3.4 French fort construction </Li> <Li> 3.5 Virginia 's response </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4 Course of the war <Ul> <Li> 4.1 Battle of Jumonville Glen </Li> <Li> 4.2 Albany Congress </Li> <Li> 4.3 British campaigns , 1755 </Li> <Li> 4.4 French victories , 1756 -- 1757 </Li> <Li> 4.5 British conquest , 1758 -- 1760 <Ul> <Li> 4.5. 1 1758 </Li> <Li> 4.5. 2 1759 -- 1760 </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 4.6 End of the war </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 5 Consequences </Li> <Li> 6 See also </Li> <Li> 7 Footnotes </Li> <Li> 8 Further reading </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> The origin of the name </H2> <P> The conflict is known by multiple names . In British America , wars were often named after the sitting British monarch , such as King William 's War or Queen Anne 's War . There had already been a King George 's War in the 1740s during King George 's reign , so British colonists named this conflict after their opponents and it became known as the French and Indian War . This traditional name continues as the standard in the United States , but it obscures the fact that Indians fought on both sides of the conflict and that this was part of the Seven Years ' War , a much larger conflict between France and Great Britain . American historians generally use the traditional name or sometimes the Seven Years ' War . Less frequently used names for the war include the Fourth Intercolonial War and the Great War for the Empire . </P> <P> In Europe , the North American theater of the Seven Years ' War usually is not given a separate name . The entire international conflict is known as the Seven Years ' War . `` Seven Years '' refers to events in Europe , from the official declaration of war in 1756 to the signing of the peace treaty in 1763 . These dates do not correspond with the fighting on mainland North America which was largely concluded in six years , from the Battle of Jumonville Glen in 1754 to the capture of Montreal in 1760 . </P> <P> Canadians refer to both the European and North American conflicts as the Seven Years ' War ( Guerre de Sept Ans ) . French Canadians also use the term `` War of Conquest '' ( Guerre de la Conquête ) , since it is the war in which Canada was conquered by the British and became part of the British Empire . </P> <H2> North America in the 1750s </H2> Map showing the 1750 possessions of Britain ( pink ) , France ( blue ) , and Spain ( green ) in North America <P> At this time , North America east of the Mississippi River was largely claimed by either Great Britain or France . Large areas had no colonial settlements . The French population numbered about 75,000 and was heavily concentrated along the St. Lawrence River valley , with some also in Acadia ( present - day New Brunswick and parts of Nova Scotia ) , including Île Royale ( present - day Cape Breton Island ) . Fewer lived in New Orleans , Biloxi , Mississippi , Mobile , Alabama , and small settlements in the Illinois Country , hugging the east side of the Mississippi River and its tributaries . French fur traders and trappers traveled throughout the St. Lawrence and Mississippi watersheds , did business with local Indian tribes , and often married Indian women . Traders married daughters of chiefs , creating high - ranking unions . </P> <P> British settlers outnumbered the French 20 to 1 with a population of about 1.5 million ranged along the eastern coast of the continent from Nova Scotia and Newfoundland in the north to Georgia in the south . Many of the older colonies had land claims that extended arbitrarily far to the west , as the extent of the continent was unknown at the time when their provincial charters were granted . Their population centers were along the coast , yet the settlements were growing into the interior . Nova Scotia had been captured from France in 1713 , and it still had a significant French - speaking population . Britain also claimed Rupert 's Land where the Hudson 's Bay Company traded for furs with local Indian tribes . </P> Iroquois engaging in trade with colonists , 1722 <P> In between the French and British colonists , large areas were dominated by Indian tribes . To the north , the Mi'kmaqs and the Abenakis were engaged in Father Le Loutre 's War and still held sway in parts of Nova Scotia , Acadia , and the eastern portions of the province of Canada , as well as much of Maine . The Iroquois Confederation dominated much of Upstate New York and the Ohio Country , although Ohio also included Algonquian - speaking populations of Delaware and Shawnee , as well as Iroquoian - speaking Mingos . These tribes were formally under Iroquois rule and were limited by them in their authority to make agreements . </P> <P> The Southeast interior was dominated by Siouan - speaking Catawbas , Muskogee - speaking Creeks and Choctaw , and the Iroquoian - speaking Cherokee tribes . When war broke out , the French colonists used their trading connections to recruit fighters from tribes in western portions of the Great Lakes region , which was not directly subject to the conflict between the French and British ; these included the Hurons , Mississaugs , Ojibwas , Winnebagos , and Potawatomi . The British colonists were supported in the war by the Iroquois Six Nations and also by the Cherokees , until differences sparked the Anglo - Cherokee War in 1758 . In 1758 , the Pennsylvania government successfully negotiated the Treaty of Easton in which a number of tribes in the Ohio Country promised neutrality in exchange for land concessions and other considerations . Most of the other northern tribes sided with the French , their primary trading partner and supplier of arms . The Creeks and Cherokees were subject to diplomatic efforts by both the French and British to gain either their support or neutrality in the conflict . </P> <P> By this time , Spain claimed only the province of Florida in eastern North America ; it controlled Cuba and other territories in the West Indies that became military objectives in the Seven Years ' War . Florida 's European population was a few hundred , concentrated in St. Augustine and Pensacola . </P> New York and Pennsylvania theaters of the war , image from 1905 <P> At the start of the war , no French regular army troops were stationed in North America , and few British troops . New France was defended by about 3,000 troupes de la marine , companies of colonial regulars ( some of whom had significant woodland combat experience ) . The colonial government recruited militia support when needed . Most British colonies mustered local militia companies to deal with Indian threats , generally ill trained and available only for short periods , but they did not have any standing forces . Virginia , by contrast , had a large frontier with several companies of British regulars . </P> <P> The colonial governments were used to operating independently of one another and of the government in London , a situation that complicated negotiations with Indian tribes , whose territories often encompassed land claimed by multiple colonies . After the war began , the leaders of the British Army establishment tried to impose constraints and demands on the colonial administrations . </P> <H2> Events leading to War </H2> <H3> Céloron 's expedition </H3> <P> New France 's Governor - General Roland - Michel Barrin de La Galissonière was concerned about the incursion and expanding influence in the Ohio Country of British colonial traders such as George Croghan . In June 1747 , he ordered Pierre - Joseph Céloron to lead a military expedition through the area . Its objectives were : </P> <Ul> <Li> to reaffirm to New France 's Indian allies that their trading arrangements with colonists were exclusive to those authorized by New France </Li> <Li> to confirm Indian assistance in asserting and maintaining the French claim to the territories which French explorers had claimed </Li> <Li> to discourage any alliances between Britain and local Indian tribes </Li> <Li> to impress the Indians with a French show of force against British colonial settler incursion , unauthorized trading expeditions , and general trespass against French claims </Li> </Ul> <P> Céloron 's expedition force consisted of about 200 Troupes de la marine and 30 Indians , and they covered about 3,000 miles ( 4,800 km ) between June and November 1749 . They went up the St. Lawrence , continued along the northern shore of Lake Ontario , crossed the portage at Niagara , and followed the southern shore of Lake Erie . At the Chautauqua Portage near Barcelona , New York , the expedition moved inland to the Allegheny River which it followed to the site of Pittsburgh . There Céloron buried lead plates engraved with the French claim to the Ohio Country . Whenever he encountered British colonial merchants or fur - traders , he informed them of the French claims on the territory and told them to leave . </P> <P> Céloron 's expedition arrived at Logstown where the Indians in the area informed him that they owned the Ohio Country and that they would trade with the British colonists regardless of the French . He continued south until his expedition reached the confluence of the Ohio and the Miami rivers which lay just south of the village of Pickawillany , the home of the Miami chief known as `` Old Briton '' . Céloron threatened Old Briton with severe consequences if he continued to trade with British colonists , but Old Briton ignored the warning . Céloron returned disappointedly to Montreal in November 1749 . </P> <P> Céloron wrote an extensively detailed report . `` All I can say is that the Natives of these localities are very badly disposed towards the French , '' he wrote , `` and are entirely devoted to the English . I do n't know in what way they could be brought back . '' Even before his return to Montreal , reports on the situation in the Ohio Country were making their way to London and Paris , each side proposing that action be taken . Massachusetts governor William Shirley was particularly forceful , stating that British colonists would not be safe as long as the French were present . </P> <H3> Negotiations </H3> <P> In 1749 , the British government gave land to the Ohio Company of Virginia for the purpose of developing trade and settlements in the Ohio Country . The grant required that it settle 100 families in the territory and construct a fort for their protection . But the territory was also claimed by Pennsylvania , and both colonies began pushing for action to improve their respective claims . In 1750 , Christopher Gist explored the Ohio territory , acting on behalf of both Virginia and the company , and he opened negotiations with the Indian tribes at Logstown . He completed the 1752 Treaty of Logstown in which the local Indians agreed to terms through their `` Half - King '' Tanacharison and an Iroquois representative . These terms included permission to build a strong house at the mouth of the Monongahela River on the modern site of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania . By the late 17th century , the Iroquois had pushed many tribes out of the Ohio Valley , and they laid claim to it as their hunting ground by right of conquest . </P> <P> The War of the Austrian Succession ( better known as King George 's War ) formally ended in 1748 with the signing of the Treaty of Aix - la - Chapelle which was primarily focused on resolving issues in Europe . The issues of conflicting territorial claims between British and French colonies were turned over to a commission , but it reached no decision . Frontier areas were claimed by both sides , from Nova Scotia and Acadia in the north to the Ohio Country in the south . The disputes also extended into the Atlantic Ocean , where both powers wanted access to the rich fisheries of the Grand Banks off Newfoundland . </P> <H3> Attack on Pickawillany </H3> Main article : Raid on Pickawillany <P> Governor - General of New France Marquis de la Jonquière died on March 17 , 1752 , and he was temporarily replaced by Charles le Moyne de Longueuil . His permanent replacement was to be the Marquis Duquesne , but he did not arrive in New France until 1752 to take over the post . The continuing British activity in the Ohio territories prompted Longueuil to dispatch another expedition to the area under the command of Charles Michel de Langlade , an officer in the Troupes de la Marine . Langlade was given 300 men , including French - Canadians and warriors of the Ottawa tribe . His objective was to punish the Miami people of Pickawillany for not following Céloron 's orders to cease trading with the British . On June 21 , the French war party attacked the trading centre at Pickawillany , capturing three traders and killing 14 Miami Indians , including Old Briton . He was reportedly ritually cannibalized by some Indians in the expedition party . </P> <H3> French Fort construction </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .

( April 2017 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this template message ) </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> In the spring of 1753 , Paul Marin de la Malgue was given command of a 2,000 - man force of Troupes de la Marine and Indians . His orders were to protect the King 's land in the Ohio Valley from the British . Marin followed the route that Céloron had mapped out four years earlier . Céloron , however , had limited the record of French claims to the burial of lead plates , whereas Marin constructed and garrisoned forts . He first constructed Fort Presque Isle on Lake Erie 's south shore near Erie , Pennsylvania , and he had a road built to the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek . He then constructed a second fort at Fort Le Boeuf in Waterford , Pennsylvania ) , designed to guard the headwaters of LeBoeuf Creek . As he moved south , he drove off or captured British traders , alarming both the British and the Iroquois . Tanaghrisson was a chief of the Mingo Indians , who were remnants of Iroquois and other tribes who had been driven west by colonial expansion . He intensely disliked the French whom he accused of killing and eating his father . He traveled to Fort Le Boeuf and threatened the French with military action , which Marin contemptuously dismissed . </P> Robert Dinwiddie , British lieutenant governor of Virginia <P> The Iroquois sent runners to the manor of William Johnson in upstate New York , who was the British Superintendent for Indian Affairs in the New York region and beyond . Johnson was known to the Iroquois as Warraghiggey , meaning `` he who does great things . '' He spoke their languages and had become a respected honorary member of the Iroquois Confederacy in the area , and he was made a colonel of the Iroquois in 1746 ; he was later commissioned as a colonel of the Western New York Militia . </P> <P> The Indian representatives and Johnson met with Governor Clinton and officials from some of the other American colonies at Albany , New York . Mohawk Chief Hendrick was the speaker of their tribal council , and he insisted that the British abide by their obligations and block French expansion . Clinton did not respond to his satisfaction , and Hendrick said that the `` Covenant Chain '' was broken , a long - standing friendly relationship between the Iroquois Confederacy and the British Crown . </P> <H3> Virginia 's response </H3> <P> Governor Robert Dinwiddie of Virginia was an investor in the Ohio Company which stood to lose money if the French held their claim . He ordered 21 year - old Major George Washington ( whose brother was another Ohio Company investor ) of the Virginia Regiment to warn the French to leave Virginia territory in October 1753 . Washington left with a small party , picking up Jacob Van Braam as an interpreter , Christopher Gist ( a company surveyor working in the area ) , and a few Mingos led by Tanaghrisson . On December 12 , Washington and his men reached Fort Le Boeuf . </P> <P> Jacques Legardeur de Saint - Pierre succeeded Marin as commander of the French forces after Marin died on October 29 , and he invited Washington to dine with him . Over dinner , Washington presented Saint - Pierre with the letter from Dinwiddie demanding an immediate French withdrawal from the Ohio Country . Saint - Pierre said , `` As to the Summons you send me to retire , I do not think myself obliged to obey it . '' He told Washington that France 's claim to the region was superior to that of the British , since René - Robert Cavelier , Sieur de La Salle had explored the Ohio Country nearly a century earlier . </P> Washington 's map of the Ohio River and surrounding region containing notes on French intentions , 1753 or 1754 <P> Washington 's party left Fort Le Boeuf early on December 16 and arrived in Williamsburg on January 16 , 1754 . He stated in his report , `` The French had swept south '' , detailing the steps which they had taken to fortify the area , and their intention to fortify the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers . </P> <H2> Course of the War </H2> <P> Even before Washington returned , Dinwiddie had sent a company of 40 men under William Trent to that point where they began construction of a small stockaded fort in the early months of 1754 . Governor Duquesne sent additional French forces under Claude - Pierre Pecaudy de Contrecœur to relieve Saint - Pierre during the same period , and Contrecœur led 500 men south from Fort Venango on April 5 , 1754 . These forces arrived at the fort on April 16 , but Contrecœur generously allowed Trent 's small company to withdraw . He purchased their construction tools to continue building what became Fort Duquesne . </P> <H3> Battle of Jumonville Glen </H3> <P> Dinwiddie had ordered Washington to lead a larger force to assist Trent in his work , and Washington learned of Trent 's retreat while he was en route . Mingo sachem Tanaghrisson had promised support to the British , so Washington continued toward Fort Duquesne and met with him . He then learned of a French scouting party in the area , so he combined Tanaghrisson 's force with his own and surprised the Canadians on May 28 in what became known as the Battle of Jumonville Glen . They killed many of the Canadians , including their commanding officer Joseph Coulon de Jumonville , whose head was reportedly split open by Tanaghrisson with a tomahawk . Historian Fred Anderson suggests that Tanaghrisson was acting to gain the support of the British and to regain authority over his own people . They had been inclined to support the French , with whom they had long trading relationships . One of Tanaghrisson 's men told Contrecoeur that Jumonville had been killed by British musket fire . </P> <P> Historians generally consider the Battle of Jumonville Glen as the opening battle of the French and Indian War in North America , and the start of hostilities in the Ohio valley . </P> The earliest authenticated portrait of George Washington shows him wearing his colonel 's uniform of the Virginia Regiment . This portrait was painted in 1772 by Charles Willson Peale . <P> Following the battle , Washington pulled back several miles and established Fort Necessity , which the Canadians attacked under the command of Jummonville 's brother at the Battle of Fort Necessity on July 3 . Washington surrendered and negotiated a withdrawal under arms . One of his men reported that the Canadian force was accompanied by Shawnee , Delaware , and Mingo warriors -- just those whom Tanaghrisson was seeking to influence . </P> <P> News of the two battles reached England in August . After several months of negotiations , the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French . They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition . Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock 's departure for North America . In response , King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755 . The British sent out their fleet in February 1755 , intending to blockade French ports , but the French fleet had already sailed . Admiral Edward Hawke detached a fast squadron to North America in an attempt to intercept them . </P> <P> In a second British action , Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide on June 8 , 1755 , capturing her and two troop ships . The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755 , seizing ships and capturing seamen . These actions contributed to the eventual formal declarations of war in spring 1756 . </P> <H3> Albany congress </H3> <P> An early important political response to the opening of hostilities was the convening of the Albany Congress in June and July , 1754 . The goal of the congress was to formalize a unified front in trade and negotiations with various Indians , since allegiance of the various tribes and nations was seen to be pivotal in the war that was unfolding . The plan that the delegates agreed to was neither ratified by the colonial legislatures nor approved of by the crown . Nevertheless , the format of the congress and many specifics of the plan became the prototype for confederation during the War of Independence . </P> <H3> British campaigns , 1755 </H3> Locations of British campaigns , 1755 ( and other sites ) <P> The British formed an aggressive plan of operations for 1755 . General Braddock was to lead the expedition to Fort Duquesne , while Massachusetts governor William Shirley was given the task of fortifying Fort Oswego and attacking Fort Niagara , and Sir William Johnson was to capture Fort St. Frédéric at present - day Crown Point , New York . Lieutenant Colonel Robert Monckton was to capture Fort Beauséjour to the east , on the frontier between Nova Scotia and Acadia . </P> <P> Braddock led about 1,500 army troops and provincial militia on an expedition in June 1755 to take Fort Duquesne , with George Washington as one of his aides . The expedition was a disaster . It was attacked by French soldiers and Indian warriors ambushing them from up in trees and behind logs , and Braddock called for a retreat . He was killed and approximately 1,000 British soldiers were killed or injured . The remaining 500 British troops retreated to Virginia , led by George Washington . Two future opponents in the American Revolutionary War played key roles in organizing the retreat : Washington and Thomas Gage . </P> <P> The French acquired a copy of the British war plans , including the activities of Shirley and Johnson . Shirley 's efforts to fortify Oswego were bogged down in logistical difficulties , exacerbated by his inexperience in managing large expeditions . In conjunction , Shirley was made aware that the French were massing for an attack on Fort Oswego in his absence when he planned to attack Fort Niagara . As a response , he left garrisons at Oswego , Fort Bull , and Fort Williams , the last two located on the Oneida Carry between the Mohawk River and Wood Creek at present - day Rome , New York . Supplies were cached at Fort Bull for use in the projected attack on Niagara . </P> William Johnson saving Baron Deskiau <P> Johnson 's expedition was better organized than Shirley 's , which was noticed by New France 's governor the Marquis de Vaudreuil . He had primarily been concerned about the extended supply line to the forts on the Ohio , and he had sent Baron Dieskau to lead the defenses at Frontenac against Shirley 's expected attack . Vaudreuil saw Johnson as the larger threat and sent Dieskau to Fort St. Frédéric to meet that threat . Dieskau planned to attack the British encampment at Fort Edward at the upper end of navigation on the Hudson River , but Johnson had strongly fortified it , and Dieskau 's Indian support was reluctant to attack . The two forces finally met in the bloody Battle of Lake George between Fort Edward and Fort William Henry . The battle ended inconclusively , with both sides withdrawing from the field . Johnson 's advance stopped at Fort William Henry , and the French withdrew to Ticonderoga Point , where they began the construction of Fort Carillon ( later renamed Fort Ticonderoga after British capture in 1759 ) . </P> <P> Colonel Monckton captured Fort Beauséjour in June 1755 in the sole British success that year , cutting off the French fortress at Louisbourg from land - based reinforcements . To cut vital supplies to Louisbourg , Nova Scotia 's Governor Charles Lawrence ordered the deportation of the French - speaking Acadian population from the area . Monckton 's forces , including companies of Rogers ' Rangers , forcibly removed thousands of Acadians , chasing down many who resisted and sometimes committing atrocities . More than any other factor , cutting off supplies to Louisbourg led to its demise . The Acadian resistance was sometimes quite stiff , in concert with Indian allies including the Mi'kmaq , with ongoing frontier raids against Dartmouth and Lunenburg , among others . The only clashes of any size were at Petitcodiac in 1755 and at Bloody Creek near Annapolis Royal in 1757 , other than the campaigns to expel the Acadians ranging around the Bay of Fundy , on the Petitcodiac and St. John rivers , and Île Saint - Jean . </P> <H3> French victories , 1756 -- 1757 </H3> See also : Franco - Indian alliance Conference between the French and Indian leaders around a ceremonial fire , by Émile Louis Vernier <P> Following the death of Braddock , William Shirley assumed command of British forces in North America , and he laid out his plans for 1756 at a meeting in Albany in December 1755 . He proposed renewing the efforts to capture Niagara , Crown Point , and Duquesne , with attacks on Fort Frontenac on the north shore of Lake Ontario and an expedition through the wilderness of the Maine district and down the Chaudière River to attack the city of Quebec . His plan , however , got bogged down by disagreements and disputes with others , including William Johnson and New York 's Governor Sir Charles Hardy , and consequently gained little support . </P> <P> Newcastle replaced him in January 1756 with Lord Loudoun , with Major General James Abercrombie as his second in command . Neither of these men had as much campaign experience as the trio of officers whom France sent to North America . French regular army reinforcements arrived in New France in May 1756 , led by Major General Louis - Joseph de Montcalm and seconded by the Chevalier de Lévis and Colonel François - Charles de Bourlamaque , all experienced veterans from the War of the Austrian Succession . On May 18 , 1756 , England formally declared war on France , which expanded the war into Europe and came to be known as the Seven Years ' War . </P> General Louis - Joseph de Montcalm <P> Governor Vaudreuil had ambitions to become the French commander in chief , in addition to his role as governor , and he acted during the winter of 1756 before those reinforcements arrived . Scouts had reported the weakness of the British supply chain , so he ordered an attack against the forts which Shirley had erected at the Oneida Carry . In the Battle of Fort Bull , French forces destroyed the fort and large quantities of supplies , including 45,000 pounds of gunpowder . They set back any British hopes for campaigns on Lake Ontario and endangered the Oswego garrison , already short on supplies . French forces in the Ohio valley also continued to intrigue with Indians throughout the area , encouraging them to raid frontier settlements . This led to ongoing alarms along the western frontiers , with streams of refugees returning east to get away from the action . </P> <P> The new British command was not in place until July . Abercrombie arrived in Albany but refused to take any significant actions until Loudoun approved them , and Montcalm took bold action against his inertia . He built on Vaudreuil 's work harassing the Oswego garrison and executed a strategic feint by moving his headquarters to Ticonderoga , as if to presage another attack along Lake George . With Abercrombie pinned down at Albany , Montcalm slipped away and led the successful attack on Oswego in August . In the aftermath , Montcalm and the Indians under his command disagreed about the disposition of prisoners ' personal effects . The Europeans did not consider them prizes and prevented the Indians from stripping the prisoners of their valuables , which angered the Indians . </P> Montcalm trying to stop allied Indians from the massacre of colonial soldiers and civilians as they leave after the Battle of Fort William Henry . <P> Loudoun was a capable administrator but a cautious field commander , and he planned one major operation for 1757 : an attack on New France 's capital of Quebec . He left a sizable force at Fort William Henry to distract Montcalm and began organizing for the expedition to Quebec . He was then ordered to attack Louisbourg first by William Pitt , the Secretary of State responsible for the colonies . The expedition was beset by delays of all kinds but was finally ready to sail from Halifax , Nova Scotia in early August . In the meantime , French ships had escaped the British blockade of the French coast , and a fleet awaited Loudoun at Louisbourg which outnumbered the British fleet . Faced with this strength , Loudoun returned to New York amid news that a massacre had occurred at Fort William Henry . </P> <P> French irregular forces ( Canadian scouts and Indians ) harassed Fort William Henry throughout the first half of 1757 . In January , they ambushed British rangers near Ticonderoga . In February , they launched a raid against the position across the frozen Lake George , destroying storehouses and buildings outside the main fortification . In early August , Montcalm and 7,000 troops besieged the fort , which capitulated with an agreement to withdraw under parole . When the withdrawal began , some of Montcalm 's Indian allies attacked the British column because they were angry about the lost opportunity for loot , killing and capturing several hundred men , women , children , and slaves . The aftermath of the siege may have contributed to the transmission of smallpox into remote Indian populations , as some Indians were reported to have traveled from beyond the Mississippi to participate in the campaign and returned afterward . Modern writer William Nester believes that the Indians might have been exposed to European carriers , although no proof exists . </P> <H3> British Conquest , 1758 -- 1760 </H3> See also : Great Britain in the Seven Years ' War § Conquest of Canada ( 1758 -- 60 ) The Victory of Montcalm 's Troops at Carillon by Henry Alexander Ogden . <P> Vaudreuil and Montcalm were minimally resupplied in 1758 , as the British blockade of the French coastline limited French shipping . The situation in New France was further exacerbated by a poor harvest in 1757 , a difficult winter , and the allegedly corrupt machinations of François Bigot , the intendant of the territory . His schemes to supply the colony inflated prices and were believed by Montcalm to line his pockets and those of his associates . A massive outbreak of smallpox among western Indian tribes led many of them to stay away from trading in 1758 . The disease probably spread through the crowded conditions at William Henry after the battle ; yet the Indians blamed the French for bringing `` bad medicine '' as well as denying them prizes at Fort William Henry . </P> <P> Montcalm focused his meager resources on the defense of the St. Lawrence , with primary defenses at Carillon , Quebec , and Louisbourg , while Vaudreuil argued unsuccessfully for a continuation of the raiding tactics that had worked quite effectively in previous years . The British failures in North America combined with other failures in the European theater and led to Newcastle 's fall from power along with the Duke of Cumberland , his principal military advisor . </P> <P> Newcastle and Pitt joined in an uneasy coalition in which Pitt dominated the military planning . He embarked on a plan for the 1758 campaign that was largely developed by Loudoun . He had been replaced by Abercrombie as commander in chief after the failures of 1757 . Pitt 's plan called for three major offensive actions involving large numbers of regular troops supported by the provincial militias , aimed at capturing the heartlands of New France . Two of the expeditions were successful , with Fort Duquesne and Louisbourg falling to sizable British forces . </P> 1758 Indians ambush British soldiers <P> The Forbes Expedition was a British campaign in September -- October 1758 , with 6,000 troops led by General John Forbes sent to drive out the French from the contested Ohio Country . The French withdrew from Fort Duquesne and left the British in control of the Ohio River Valley . The great French fortress at Louisbourg in Nova Scotia was captured after a siege . </P> <P> The third invasion was stopped with the improbable French victory in the Battle of Carillon , in which 3,600 Frenchmen defeated Abercrombie 's force of 18,000 regulars , militia , and Indian allies outside the fort which the French called Carillon and the British called Ticonderoga . Abercrombie saved something from the disaster when he sent John Bradstreet on an expedition that successfully destroyed Fort Frontenac , including caches of supplies destined for New France 's western forts and furs destined for Europe . Abercrombie was recalled and replaced by Jeffery Amherst , victor at Louisbourg . </P> Battle of Quebec , 13 September 1759 , painted by Captain Hervey Smyth <P> The French had generally poor results in 1758 in most theaters of the war . The new foreign minister was the duc de Choiseul , and he decided to focus on an invasion of Britain to draw British resources away from North America and the European mainland . The invasion failed both militarily and politically , as Pitt again planned significant campaigns against New France and sent funds to Britain 's mainland ally of Prussia , while the French Navy failed in the 1759 naval battles at Lagos and Quiberon Bay . In one piece of good fortune , some French supply ships did manage to depart France and elude the British blockade of the French coast . </P> 1759 -- 1760 See also : Conquest of 1760 British General Jeffery Amherst <P> British victories continued in all theaters in the Annus Mirabilis of 1759 : the British captured Ticonderoga , James Wolfe defeated Montcalm at Quebec in a battle that claimed the lives of both commanders , and a British victory at Fort Niagara cut off the French frontier forts to the west and south . The victory was made complete in 1760 ; the British did suffer a defeat outside Quebec City in the Battle of Sainte - Foy , but they prevented the arrival of French relief ships in the naval Battle of the Restigouche while armies marched on Montreal from three sides . </P> <P> Governor Vaudreuil in Montreal negotiated a capitulation with General Amherst in September 1760 . Amherst granted his requests that any French residents who chose to remain in the colony would be given freedom to continue worshiping in their Roman Catholic tradition , to own property , and to remain undisturbed in their homes . The British provided medical treatment for the sick and wounded French soldiers , and French regular troops were returned to France aboard British ships with an agreement that they were not to serve again in the present war . </P> <H3> End of the War </H3> The descent of the French on St. John 's , Newfoundland , 1762 <P> Most of the fighting ended in continental North America in 1760 , although it continued in Europe between France and Britain . The notable exception was the French seizure of St. John 's , Newfoundland . General Amherst heard of this surprise action and immediately dispatched troops under his nephew William Amherst , who regained control of Newfoundland after the Battle of Signal Hill in September 1762 . Many troops from North America were reassigned to participate in further British actions in the West Indies , including the capture of Spanish Havana when Spain belatedly entered the conflict on the side of France , and a British expedition against French Martinique in 1762 led by Major General Robert Monckton . </P> <P> General Amherst also oversaw the transition of French forts to British control in the western lands . The policies which he introduced in those lands disturbed large numbers of Indians and contributed to Pontiac 's Rebellion in 1763 . This series of attacks on frontier forts and settlements required the continued deployment of British troops , and it was not resolved until 1766 . </P> Distribution of British military forces in 1766 <P> The war in North America officially ended with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on 10 February 1763 , and war in the European theater was settled by the Treaty of Hubertusburg on 15 February 1763 . The British offered France the choice of surrendering either its continental North American possessions east of the Mississippi or the Caribbean islands of Guadeloupe and Martinique , which had been occupied by the British . France chose to cede the former but was able to negotiate the retention of Saint Pierre and Miquelon , two small islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence , along with fishing rights in the area . They viewed the economic value of the Caribbean islands ' sugar cane to be greater and easier to defend than the furs from the continent . French philosopher Voltaire referred to Canada disparagingly as nothing more than a few acres of snow . The British , however , were happy to take New France , as defence of their North American colonies would no longer be an issue ; they also had ample places from which to obtain sugar . Spain traded Florida to Britain in order to regain Cuba , but they also gained Louisiana from France , including New Orleans , in compensation for their losses . Great Britain and Spain also agreed that navigation on the Mississippi River was to be open to vessels of all nations . </P> <H2> Consequences </H2> <P> The war changed economic , political , governmental , and social relations among the three European powers , their colonies , and the people who inhabited those territories . France and Britain both suffered financially because of the war , with significant long - term consequences . </P> Map showing British territorial gains following the Treaty of Paris in pink , and Spanish territorial gains after the Treaty of Fontainebleau in yellow <P> Britain gained control of French Canada and Acadia , colonies containing approximately 80,000 primarily French - speaking Roman Catholic residents . The deportation of Acadians beginning in 1755 made land available to immigrants from Europe and migrants from the colonies to the south . The British resettled many Acadians throughout its North American provinces , but many went to France , and some went to New Orleans , which they had expected to remain French . Some were sent to colonize places as diverse as French Guiana and the Falkland Islands , but these efforts were unsuccessful . Others migrated to places such as Saint - Domingue or fled to New Orleans after the Haitian Revolution . The Louisiana population contributed to the founding of the modern Cajun population . ( The French word `` Acadien '' changed to `` Cadien '' then to `` Cajun '' . ) </P> <P> Following the treaty , King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763 on October 7 , 1763 which outlined the division and administration of the newly conquered territory , and it continues to govern relations to some extent between the government of modern Canada and the First Nations . Included in its provisions was the reservation of lands west of the Appalachian Mountains to its Indian population , a demarcation that was only a temporary impediment to a rising tide of westward - bound settlers . The proclamation also contained provisions that prevented civic participation by the Roman Catholic Canadians . The Quebec Act addressed this and other issues in 1774 , raising concerns in the largely Protestant Thirteen Colonies over the advance of `` popery . '' The Act maintained French Civil law , including the seigneurial system , a medieval code removed from France within a generation by the French Revolution . </P> The deportation order is read to a group of Acadians in 1755 <P> The Seven Years ' War nearly doubled Great Britain 's national debt . The Crown sought sources of revenue to pay it off and attempted to impose new taxes on its colonies . These attempts were met with increasingly stiff resistance , until troops were called in to enforce the Crown 's authority . These acts ultimately led to the start of the American Revolutionary War . </P> <P> France attached comparatively little value to its North American possessions , apart from the highly profitable sugar - producing Antilles islands which it retained . Minister Choiseul considered that he had made a good deal at the Treaty of Paris , and Voltaire wrote that Louis XV had lost `` a few acres of snow '' . For France , however , the military defeat and the financial burden of the war weakened the monarchy and contributed to the advent of the French Revolution in 1789 . </P> <P> For some of the Indian tribes , the elimination of French power in North America meant the disappearance of a strong ally , although other tribes were not so affected . The Ohio Country was now more available to colonial settlement , due to the construction of military roads by Braddock and Forbes . The Spanish takeover of the Louisiana territory was not completed until 1769 , and it had modest repercussions . The British takeover of Spanish Florida resulted in the westward migration of Indian tribes who did not want to do business with them . This migration also caused a rise in tensions between the Choctaw and the Creek , historic enemies who were now competing for land . The change of control in Florida also prompted most of its Spanish Catholic population to leave . Most went to Cuba , including the entire governmental records from St. Augustine , although some Christianized Yamasee were resettled to the coast of Mexico . </P> <P> France returned to North America in 1778 with the establishment of a Franco - American alliance against Great Britain in the American War of Independence . This time , France succeeded in prevailing over Great Britain in what historian Alfred A. Cave describes as `` French ... revenge for Montcalm 's death '' . </P> <H2> See also </H2> <Ul> <Li> History of Canada portal </Li> <Li> New France portal </Li> </Ul> <Ul> <Li> French and Indian Wars ( article includes King William 's War , Queen Anne 's War , King George 's War , and this war . ) </Li> <Li> Military history of Nova Scotia </Li> <Li> Northwest Indian War </Li> <Li> Franco - Indian alliance </Li> <Li> Great Britain in the Seven Years ' War </Li> <Li> New Hampshire Provincial Regiment </Li> <Li> American Indian Wars </Li> </Ul> <H2> Footnotes </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Brumwell , pp. 26 -- 31 , documents the starting sizes of the expeditions against Louisbourg , Carillon , Duquesne , and West Indies . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Brumwell , pp. 24 -- 25 . </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ Gary Walton ; History of the American Economy ; page 27 </Li> <Li> Jump up ^ M.

It forms the first part of the Constitution Act , 1982 . The Charter guarantees certain political rights to Canadian citizens and civil rights of everyone in Canada from the policies and actions of all areas and levels of the government . It is designed to unify Canadians around a set of principles that embody those rights . The Charter was signed into law by Queen Elizabeth II of Canada on April 17 , 1982 , along with the rest of the Act . </P> <P> The Charter was preceded by the Canadian Bill of Rights , which was enacted in 1960 . However , the Bill of Rights is only a federal statute , rather than a constitutional document . As a federal statute , it can be amended through the ordinary legislative process and has no application to provincial laws . The Supreme Court of Canada also narrowly interpreted the Bill of Rights and the Court was reluctant to declare laws inoperative . The relative ineffectiveness of the Canadian Bill of Rights motivated many to improve rights protections in Canada . The movement for human rights and freedoms that emerged after World War II also wanted to entrench the principles enunciated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . The British Parliament formally enacted the Charter as a part of the Canada Act 1982 at the request of the Parliament of Canada in 1982 , the result of the efforts of the government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . </P> <P> One of the most notable effects of the adoption of the Charter was to greatly expand the scope of judicial review , because the Charter is more explicit with respect to the guarantee of rights and the role of judges in enforcing them than was the Bill of Rights . The courts , when confronted with violations of Charter rights , have struck down unconstitutional federal and provincial statutes and regulations or parts of statutes and regulations , as they did when Canadian case law was primarily concerned with resolving issues of federalism . The Charter , however , granted new powers to the courts to enforce remedies that are more creative and to exclude more evidence in trials . These powers are greater than what was typical under the common law and under a system of government that , influenced by Canada 's parent country the United Kingdom , was based upon Parliamentary supremacy . As a result , the Charter has attracted both broad support from a majority of the Canadian electorate and criticisms by opponents of increased judicial power . The Charter only applies to government laws and actions ( including the laws and actions of federal , provincial , and municipal governments and public school boards ) , and sometimes to the common law , not to private activity . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Features <Ul> <Li> 1.1 Exceptions </Li> <Li> 1.2 Fundamental freedoms </Li> <Li> 1.3 Democratic rights </Li> <Li> 1.4 Mobility rights </Li> <Li> 1.5 Legal rights </Li> <Li> 1.6 Equality rights </Li> <Li> 1.7 Language rights </Li> <Li> 1.8 Minority language education rights </Li> <Li> 1.9 Other sections </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 2 History </Li> <Li> 3 Interpretation and enforcement </Li> <Li> 4 Comparisons with other human rights documents </Li> <Li> 5 The Charter and national values </Li> <Li> 6 Criticism </Li> <Li> 7 See also </Li> <Li> 8 References </Li> <Li> 9 Further reading </Li> <Li> 10 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Features ( edit ) </H2> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Part of the Constitution Act , 1982 . </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Preamble </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Guarantee of Rights and Freedoms </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Fundamental Freedoms </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Democratic Rights </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 3 , 4 , 5 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Mobility Rights </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 6 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Legal Rights </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 , 14 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Equality Rights </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 15 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Official Languages of Canada </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 16 , 16.1 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Minority Language Education Rights </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 23 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Enforcement </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 24 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> General </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 , 29 , 30 , 31 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Application of Charter </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 32 , 33 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Th> Citation </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> 34 </Td> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> <Ul> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> <Li> </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Under the Charter , people physically present in Canada have numerous civil and political rights . Most of the rights can be exercised by any legal person ( the Charter does not define the corporation as a `` legal person '' ) , but a few of the rights belong exclusively to natural persons , or ( as in sections 3 and 6 ) only to citizens of Canada . The rights are enforceable by the courts through section 24 of the Charter , which allows courts discretion to award remedies to those whose rights have been denied . This section also allows courts to exclude evidence in trials if the evidence was acquired in a way that conflicts with the Charter and might damage the reputation of the justice system . Section 32 confirms that the Charter is binding on the federal government , the territories under its authority , and the provincial governments . The rights and freedoms enshrined in 34 sections of the Charter include : </P> <H3> Exceptions ( edit ) </H3> <P> Precluding all the freedoms and forming the basis of the Charter , the very first section , known as limitations clause , allows governments to justify certain infringements of Charter rights . Every case in which a court discovers a violation of the Charter would therefore require a section 1 analysis to determine if the law can still be upheld . Infringements are upheld if the purpose for the government action is to achieve what would be recognized as an urgent or important objective in a free society , and if the infringement can be `` demonstrably justified . '' Section 1 has thus been used to uphold laws against objectionable conduct such as hate speech ( e.g. , in R. v. Keegstra ) and obscenity ( e.g. , in R. v. Butler ) . Section 1 also confirms that the rights listed in the Charter are guaranteed . </P> <P> In addition , some of these rights are also subjected to the notwithstanding clause ( section 33 ) . The notwithstanding clause authorizes governments to temporarily override the rights and freedoms in sections 2 and 7 -- 15 for up to five years , subject to renewal . The Canadian federal government has never invoked it , and some have speculated that its use would be politically costly . In the past , the notwithstanding clause was invoked routinely by the province of Quebec ( which did not support the enactment of the Charter but is subject to it nonetheless ) . The provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta have also invoked the notwithstanding clause , to end a strike and to protect an exclusively heterosexual definition of marriage , respectively . ( Note that Alberta 's use of the notwithstanding clause is of no force or effect , since the definition of marriage is federal not provincial jurisdiction . ) The territory of Yukon also passed legislation once that invoked the notwithstanding clause , but the legislation was never proclaimed in force . </P> <H3> Fundamental Freedoms ( edit ) </H3> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Section 2 : which lists what the Charter calls `` fundamental freedoms '' namely freedom of conscience , freedom of religion , freedom of thought , freedom of belief , freedom of expression , freedom of the press and of other media of communication , freedom of peaceful assembly , and freedom of association . </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <H3> Democratic rights ( edit ) </H3> <P> Generally , the right to participate in political activities and the right to a democratic form of government are protected : </P> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Section 3 : the right to vote and to be eligible to serve as member of a legislature . </Dd> <Dd> Section 4 : the maximum duration of legislatures is set at five years . </Dd> <Dd> Section 5 : an annual sitting of legislatures is required as a minimum . </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <H3> Mobility rights ( edit ) </H3> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Section 6 : protects the mobility rights of Canadian citizens which include the right to enter , remain in , and leave Canada .

Specifically , the language laws in the Charter include : </P> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Section 16 : English and French are the official languages of Canada and New Brunswick . </Dd> <Dd> Section 16.1 : the English and French - speaking communities of New Brunswick have equal rights to educational and cultural institutions . </Dd> <Dd> Section 17 : the right to use either official language in Parliament or the New Brunswick legislature . </Dd> <Dd> Section 18 : the statutes and proceedings of Parliament and the New Brunswick legislature are to be printed in both official languages . </Dd> <Dd> Section 19 : both official languages may be used in federal and New Brunswick courts . </Dd> <Dd> Section 20 : the right to communicate with and be served by the federal and New Brunswick governments in either official language . </Dd> <Dd> Section 21 : other constitutional language rights outside the Charter regarding English and French are sustained . </Dd> <Dd> Section 22 : existing rights to use languages besides English and French are not affected by the fact that only English and French have language rights in the Charter . ( Hence , if there are any rights to use Aboriginal languages anywhere they would continue to exist , though they would have no direct protection under the Charter . ) </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <H3> Minority language education rights ( edit ) </H3> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Section 23 : rights for certain citizens belonging to French and English speaking minority communities to be educated in their own language . </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <H3> Other sections ( edit ) </H3> <P> Various provisions help to clarify how the Charter works in practice . These include , </P> <Dl> <Dd> <Dl> <Dd> Section 25 : states that the Charter does not derogate existing Aboriginal rights and freedoms . Aboriginal rights , including treaty rights , receive more direct constitutional protection under section 35 of the Constitution Act , 1982 . </Dd> <Dd> Section 26 : clarifies that other rights and freedoms in Canada are not invalidated by the Charter . </Dd> <Dd> Section 27 : requires the Charter to be interpreted in a multicultural context . </Dd> <Dd> Section 28 : states all Charter rights are guaranteed equally to men and women . </Dd> <Dd> Section 29 : confirms the rights of religious schools are preserved . </Dd> <Dd> Section 30 : clarifies the applicability of the Charter in the territories . </Dd> <Dd> Section 31 : confirms that the Charter does not extend the powers of legislatures . </Dd> </Dl> </Dd> </Dl> <P> Finally , Section 34 : states that Part I of the Constitution Act , 1982 , containing the first 34 sections of the Act , may be collectively referred to as the `` Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms '' . </P> <H2> History ( edit ) </H2> Printed copies of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms <P> Many of the rights and freedoms that are protected under the Charter , including the rights to freedom of speech , habeas corpus and the presumption of innocence , have their roots in a set of Canadian laws and legal precedents sometimes known as the Implied Bill of Rights . Many of these rights were also included in the Canadian Bill of Rights , which the Canadian Parliament enacted in 1960 . However , the Canadian Bill of Rights had a number of shortcomings . Unlike the Charter , it was an ordinary Act of Parliament , which could be amended by a simple majority of Parliament , and it was applicable only to the federal government . The courts also chose to interpret the Bill of Rights conservatively , only on rare occasions applying it to find a contrary law inoperative . The Bill of Rights did not contain all of the rights that are now included in the Charter , omitting , for instance , the right to vote and freedom of movement within Canada . </P> <P> The centennial of Canadian Confederation in 1967 aroused greater interest within the government in constitutional reform . Said reforms would include improving safeguards of rights , as well as patriation of the Constitution , meaning the British Parliament would no longer have to approve constitutional amendments . Subsequently , Attorney General Pierre Trudeau appointed law professor Barry Strayer to research a potential bill of rights . While writing his report , Strayer consulted with a number of notable legal scholars , including Walter Tarnopolsky . Strayer 's report advocated a number of ideas that were later incorporated into the Charter , including protection for language rights . Strayer also advocated excluding economic rights . Finally , he recommended allowing for limits on rights . Such limits are included in the Charter 's limitation and notwithstanding clauses . In 1968 , Strayer was made the Director of the Constitutional Law Division of the Privy Council Office and in 1974 he became Assistant Deputy Minister of Justice . During those years , Strayer played a role in writing the bill that was ultimately adopted . </P> <P> Meanwhile , Trudeau , who had become Liberal leader and prime minister in 1968 , still very much wanted a constitutional bill of rights . The federal government and the provinces discussed creating one during negotiations for patriation , which resulted in the Victoria Charter in 1971 . This never came to be implemented . However , Trudeau continued with his efforts to patriate the Constitution , and promised constitutional change during the 1980 Quebec referendum . He would succeed in 1982 with the passage of the Canada Act 1982 . This enacted the Constitution Act , 1982 . </P> <P> The inclusion of a charter of rights in the Constitution Act was a much - debated issue . Trudeau spoke on television in October 1980 , and announced his intention to constitutionalize a bill of rights that would include fundamental freedoms , democratic guarantees , freedom of movement , legal rights , equality and language rights . He did not want a notwithstanding clause . While his proposal gained popular support , provincial leaders opposed the potential limits on their powers . The federal Progressive Conservative opposition feared liberal bias among judges , should courts be called upon to enforce rights . Additionally , the British Parliament cited their right to uphold Canada 's old form of government . At a suggestion of the Conservatives , Trudeau 's government thus agreed to a committee of Senators and MPs to further examine the bill of rights as well as the patriation plan . During this time , 90 hours were spent on the bill of rights alone , all filmed for television , while civil rights experts and advocacy groups put forward their perceptions on the Charter 's flaws and omissions and how to remedy them . As Canada had a parliamentary system of government , and as judges were perceived not to have enforced rights well in the past , it was questioned whether the courts should be named as the enforcers of the Charter , as Trudeau wanted . Conservatives argued that elected politicians should be trusted instead . It was eventually decided that the responsibility should go to the courts . At the urging of civil libertarians , judges could even now exclude evidence in trials if acquired in breach of Charter rights in certain circumstances , something the Charter was not originally going to provide for . As the process continued , more features were added to the Charter , including equality rights for people with disabilities , more sex equality guarantees and recognition of Canada 's multiculturalism . The limitations clause was also reworded to focus less on the importance of parliamentary government and more on justifiability of limits in free societies ; the latter logic was more in line with rights developments around the world after World War II . </P> Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau was a major advocate of the Charter . <P> In its decision in the Patriation Reference ( 1981 ) , the Supreme Court of Canada had ruled there was a tradition that some provincial approval should be sought for constitutional reform . As the provinces still had doubts about the Charter 's merits , Trudeau was forced to accept the notwithstanding clause to allow governments to opt out of certain obligations . The notwithstanding clause was accepted as part of a deal called the Kitchen Accord , negotiated by the federal Attorney General Jean Chrétien , Ontario 's justice minister Roy McMurtry and Saskatchewan 's justice minister Roy Romanow . Pressure from provincial governments ( which in Canada have jurisdiction over property ) and from the country 's left wing , especially the New Democratic Party , also prevented Trudeau from including any rights protecting private property . </P> <P> Nevertheless , Quebec did not support the Charter ( or the Canada Act 1982 ) , with `` conflicting interpretations '' as to why . The opposition could have owed to the Parti Québécois leadership being allegedly uncooperative , because it was more committed to gaining sovereignty for Quebec . It could have owed to Quebec leaders being excluded from the negotiation of the Kitchen Accord , which they saw as being too centralist . It could have owed to provincial leaders ' objections to the Accord 's provisions relating to the process of future constitutional amendment . They also opposed the inclusion of mobility rights and minority language education rights . The Charter is still applicable in Quebec because all provinces are bound by the Constitution . However , Quebec 's opposition to the 1982 patriation package has led to two failed attempts to amend the Constitution ( the Meech Lake Accord and Charlottetown Accord ) which were designed primarily to obtain Quebec 's political approval of the Canadian constitutional order . </P> <P> While the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was adopted in 1982 , it was not until 1985 that the main provisions regarding equality rights ( section 15 ) came into effect . The delay was meant to give the federal and provincial governments an opportunity to review pre-existing statutes and strike potentially unconstitutional inequalities . </P> <P> The typography of the physical document pictured here , and still distributed today , was typeset by Ottawa 's David Berman intentionally in Carl Dair 's Cartier typeface : at the time the most prominent Canadian typeface , having been commissioned by the Governor - General as a celebration of Canada 's centenary in 1967 . </P> <P> The Charter has been amended since its enactment . Section 25 was amended in 1983 to explicitly recognize more rights regarding Aboriginal land claims , and section 16.1 was added in 1993 . There have also been a number of unsuccessful attempts to amend the Charter , including the failed Charlottetown Accord of 1992 . The Charlottetown Accord would have specifically required the Charter to be interpreted in a manner respectful of Quebec 's distinct society , and would have added further statements to the Constitution Act , 1867 regarding racial and sexual equality and collective rights , and about minority language communities . Though the Accord was negotiated among many interest groups , the resulting provisions were so vague that Trudeau , then out of office , feared they would actually conflict with and undermine the Charter 's individual rights . He felt judicial review of the rights might be undermined if courts had to favour the policies of provincial governments , as governments would be given responsibility over linguistic minorities . Trudeau thus played a prominent role in leading the popular opposition to the Accord . </P> <H2> Interpretation and enforcement ( edit ) </H2> <P> The task of interpreting and enforcing the Charter falls to the courts , with the Supreme Court of Canada being the ultimate authority on the matter . </P> <P> With the Charter 's supremacy confirmed by section 52 of the Constitution Act , 1982 , the courts continued their practice of striking down unconstitutional statutes or parts of statutes as they had with earlier case law regarding federalism . However , under section 24 of the Charter , courts also gained new powers to enforce creative remedies and exclude more evidence in trials . Courts have since made many important decisions , including R. v. Morgentaler ( 1988 ) , which struck down Canada 's abortion law , and Vriend v. Alberta ( 1998 ) , in which the Supreme Court found the province 's exclusion of homosexuals from protection against discrimination violated section 15 . In the latter case , the Court then read the protection into the law . </P> <P> Courts may receive Charter questions in a number of ways . Rights claimants could be prosecuted under a criminal law that they argue is unconstitutional . Others may feel government services and policies are not being dispensed in accordance with the Charter , and apply to lower - level courts for injunctions against the government ( as was the case in Doucet - Boudreau v. Nova Scotia ( Minister of Education ) ) . A government may also raise questions of rights by submitting reference questions to higher - level courts ; for example , Prime Minister Paul Martin 's government approached the Supreme Court with Charter questions as well as federalism concerns in the case Re Same - Sex Marriage ( 2004 ) . Provinces may also do this with their superior courts . The government of Prince Edward Island initiated the Provincial Judges Reference by asking its provincial Supreme Court a question on judicial independence under section 11 . </P> The building of the Supreme Court of Canada , the chief authority on the interpretation of the Charter <P> In several important cases , judges developed various tests and precedents for interpreting specific provisions of the Charter . These include the Oakes test for section 1 , set out in the case R. v. Oakes ( 1986 ) , and the ( now defunct ) Law test for section 15 , developed in Law v. Canada ( 1999 ) . Since Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act ( 1985 ) , various approaches to defining and expanding the scope of fundamental justice ( the Canadian name for natural justice or due process ) under section 7 have been adopted . ( For more information , see the articles on each Charter section ) . </P> <P> In general , courts have embraced a purposive interpretation of Charter rights . This means that since early cases like Hunter v. Southam ( 1984 ) and R. v. Big M Drug Mart ( 1985 ) , they have concentrated not on the traditional , limited understanding of what each right meant when the Charter was adopted in 1982 , but rather on changing the scope of rights as appropriate to fit their broader purpose . This is tied to the generous interpretation of rights , as the purpose of the Charter provisions is assumed to be to increase rights and freedoms of people in a variety of circumstances , at the expense of the government powers . Constitutional scholar Peter Hogg has approved of the generous approach in some cases , although for others he argues the purpose of the provisions was not to achieve a set of rights as broad as courts have imagined . Indeed , this approach has not been without its critics . Alberta politician Ted Morton and political scientist Rainer Knopff have been very critical of this phenomenon . Although they feel the basis for the approach , the living tree doctrine ( the classical name for generous interpretations of the Canadian Constitution ) , is sound , they argue Charter case law has been more radical . When the living tree doctrine is applied right , the authors claim , `` The elm remained an elm ; it grew new branches but did not transform itself into an oak or a willow . '' The doctrine can be used , for example , so a right is upheld even when a government threatens to violate it with new technology , as long as the essential right remains the same ; but the authors claim that the courts have used the doctrine to `` create new rights . '' As an example , the authors note that the Charter right against self - incrimination has been extended to cover scenarios in the justice system that had previously been unregulated by self - incrimination rights in other Canadian laws . </P> <P> Another general approach to interpreting Charter rights is to consider international legal precedents with countries that have specific rights protections , such as the United States Bill of Rights ( an influence on aspects of the Charter ) and the Constitution of South Africa . However , international precedent is only of guiding value , and is not binding . For example , the Supreme Court has referred to the Charter and the American Bill of Rights as being `` born to different countries in different ages and in different circumstances . '' </P> <P> Public interest groups frequently intervene in cases to make arguments on how to interpret the Charter . Some examples are the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association , Canadian Civil Liberties Association , the Canadian Mental Health Association , the Canadian Labour Congress , the Women 's Legal Education and Action Fund ( LEAF ) , and REAL Women of Canada . The purpose of such interventions is to assist the court and to attempt to influence the court to render a decision favourable to the legal interests of the group . </P> <P> A further approach to the Charter , taken by the courts , is the dialogue principle , which involves greater participation by elected governments . This approach involves governments drafting legislation in response to court rulings and courts acknowledging the effort if the new legislation is challenged . </P> <H2> Comparisons with other Human rights documents ( edit ) </H2> The United States Bill of Rights influenced the text of the Charter , but its rights provisions are interpreted more conservatively . Canadian civil - rights and constitutional cases as compared to American cases occasionally have dissimilar outcomes because the broader Charter rights are limited by the `` savings clause '' of section 1 of the Charter as interpreted in R. v. Oakes <P> Some Canadian Members of Parliament saw the movement to entrench a charter as contrary to the British model of Parliamentary supremacy . Others would say that the European Convention on Human Rights ( ECHR ) has now limited British parliamentary power to a greater degree than the Canadian Charter limited the power of the Canadian Parliament and provincial legislatures . Hogg has speculated that the British adopted the Human Rights Act 1998 , which allows the ECHR to be enforced directly in domestic courts , partly because they were inspired by the similar Canadian Charter . </P> <P> The Canadian Charter bears a number of similarities to the European Convention , specifically in relation to the limitations clauses contained in the European document . Because of this similarity with European human rights law , the Supreme Court of Canada turns not only to the Constitution of the United States case law in interpreting the Charter , but also to European Court of Human Rights cases . </P> <P> The core distinction between the United States Bill of Rights and Canadian Charter is the existence of the limitations and notwithstanding clauses . Canadian courts have consequently interpreted each right more expansively . However , due to the limitations clause , where a violation of a right exists , the law will not necessarily grant protection of that right . In contrast , rights under the US Bill of Rights are absolute and so a violation will not be found until there has been sufficient encroachment on those rights . The sum effect is that both constitutions provide comparable protection of many rights . Fundamental justice ( in section 7 of the Canadian Charter ) is therefore interpreted to include more legal protections than due process , which is its US equivalent . Freedom of expression in section 2 also has a more wide - ranging scope than the First Amendment to the United States Constitution 's freedom of speech . In RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd. ( 1986 ) , the Canadian Supreme Court considered picketing of the kind the US First Amendment did not permit , as it was disruptive conduct ( though there was some speech involved that the First Amendment might otherwise protect ) . The Supreme Court , however , ruled the picketing , including the disruptive conduct , were fully protected under section 2 of the Charter . The Court then relied on section 1 to find the injunction against the picketing was just . The limitations clause has also allowed governments to enact laws that would be considered unconstitutional in the US . The Supreme Court of Canada has upheld some of Quebec 's limits on the use of English on signs and has upheld publication bans that prohibit media from mentioning the names of juvenile criminals . </P> <P> Section 28 of the Charter performs a function similar to that of the unratified Equal Rights Amendment in the US . While that proposed amendment had many critics , there was no comparable opposition to the Charter 's section 28 . Still , Canadian feminists had to stage large protests to demonstrate support for the inclusion of the section which had not been part of the original draft of the charter . </P> <P> The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights has several parallels with the Canadian Charter , but in some cases the Covenant goes further with regard to rights in its text . For example , a right to legal aid has been read into section 10 of the Charter ( the right to counsel ) , but the Covenant explicitly guarantees the accused need not pay `` if he does not have sufficient means . '' </P> <P> The Canadian Charter has little to say , explicitly at least , about economic and social rights . On this point , it stands in marked contrast with the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms and with the International Covenant on Economic , Social and Cultural Rights . There are some who feel economic rights ought to be read into section 7 rights to security of the person and section 15 equality rights to make the Charter similar to the Covenant . The rationale is that economic rights can relate to a decent standard of living and can help the civil rights flourish in a livable environment . Canadian courts , however , have been hesitant in this area , stating that economic rights are political questions and adding that as positive rights , economic rights are of questionable legitimacy . </P> <P> The Charter itself influenced the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of South Africa . The limitations clause under section 36 of the South African law has been compared to section 1 of that Charter . </P> <P> Jamaica 's Charter of Fundamental Rights and Freedoms was also influenced , in part , by the Canadian charter . </P> <H2> The Charter and national values ( edit ) </H2> The `` March of Hearts '' rally for same - sex marriage equality under the Charter in 2004 . <P> The Charter was intended to be a source for Canadian values and national unity . As Professor Alan Cairns noted , `` The initial federal government premise was on developing a pan-Canadian identity . '' Trudeau himself later wrote in his Memoirs that `` Canada itself '' could now be defined as a `` society where all people are equal and where they share some fundamental values based upon freedom '' , and that all Canadians could identify with the values of liberty and equality . </P> <P> The Charter 's unifying purpose was particularly important to the mobility and language rights . According to author Rand Dyck , some scholars believe section 23 , with its minority language education rights , `` was the only part of the Charter with which Pierre Trudeau was truly concerned '' . Through the mobility and language rights , French Canadians , who have been at the centre of unity debates , are able to travel throughout all Canada and receive government and educational services in their own language . Hence , they are not confined to Quebec ( the only province where they form the majority and where most of their population is based ) , which would polarize the country along regional lines . The Charter was also supposed to standardize previously diverse laws throughout the country and gear them towards a single principle of liberty . </P> <P> Former premier of Ontario Bob Rae has stated that the Charter `` functions as a symbol for all Canadians '' in practice because it represents the core value of freedom . Academic Peter Russell has been more skeptical of the Charter 's value in this field . Cairns , who feels the Charter is the most important constitutional document to many Canadians , and that the Charter was meant to shape the Canadian identity , has also expressed concern that groups within society see certain provisions as belonging to them alone rather than to all Canadians . It has also been noted that issues like abortion and pornography , raised by the Charter , tend to be controversial . Still , opinion polls in 2002 showed Canadians felt the Charter significantly represented Canada , although many were unaware of the document 's actual contents . </P> <P> The only values mentioned by the Charter 's preamble are recognition for the supremacy of God and the rule of law , but these have been controversial and of minor legal consequence . In 1999 , MP Svend Robinson brought forward a failed proposal before the Canadian House of Commons that would have amended the Charter by removing the mention of God , as he felt it did not reflect Canada 's diversity . </P> <P> Section 27 also recognizes a value of multiculturalism . In 2002 , polls found 86 % of Canadians approved of this section . </P> <H2> Criticism ( edit ) </H2> <P> While the Charter has enjoyed a great deal of popularity , with 82 % of Canadians describing it as a good thing in opinion polls in 1987 and 1999 , the document has also been subject to published criticisms from both sides of the political spectrum . One left - wing critic is Professor Michael Mandel , who wrote that in comparison to politicians , judges do not have to be as sensitive to the will of the electorate , nor do they have to make sure their decisions are easily understandable to the average Canadian citizen . This , in Mandel 's view , limits democracy . Mandel has also asserted that the Charter makes Canada more like the United States , especially by serving corporate rights and individual rights rather than group rights and social rights . He has argued that there are several things that should be included in the Charter , such as a right to health care and a basic right to free education . Hence , the perceived Americanization of Canadian politics is seen as coming at the expense of values more important for Canadians . The union movement has been disappointed in the reluctance of the courts to use the Charter to support various forms of union activity , such as the `` right to strike '' . </P> <P> Right - wing critics Morton and Knopff have raised several concerns about the Charter , notably by alleging that the federal government has used it to limit provincial powers by allying with various rights claimants and interest groups . In their book The Charter Revolution & the Court Party , Morton and Knopff express their suspicions of this alliance in detail , accusing the Trudeau and Chrétien governments of funding litigious groups . For example , these governments used the Court Challenges Program to support minority language educational rights claims . Morton and Knopff also assert that crown counsel has intentionally lost cases in which the government was taken to court for allegedly violating rights , particularly gay rights and women 's rights . </P> <P> Political scientist Rand Dyck , in observing these criticisms , notes that while judges have had their scope of review widened , they have still upheld most laws challenged on Charter grounds . With regard to litigious interest groups , Dyck points out that `` the record is not as clear as Morton and Knopff imply . All such groups have experienced wins and losses . '' </P> <P> The political philosopher Charles Blattberg has criticized the Charter for contributing to the fragmentation of the country , at both the individual and group levels . In encouraging discourse based upon rights , the Charter is said to inject an adversarial spirit into Canadian politics , making it difficult to realize the common good . Blattberg also claims that the Charter undercuts the Canadian political community since it is ultimately a cosmopolitan document . Finally , he argues that people would be more motivated to uphold individual liberties if they were expressed with terms that are much `` thicker '' ( less abstract ) than rights . </P> <H2> See also ( edit ) </H2> <Ul> <Li> Canada portal </Li> <Li> Canadian politics portal </Li> </Ul> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> <Ul> <Li> Book : Canada </Li> </Ul> </Td> </Tr> </Table> <Ul> <Li> Canadian Bill of Rights </Li> <Li> Canadian Human Rights Act </Li> <Li> History of Canada </Li> <Li> Human rights in Canada </Li> <Li> Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms </Li> <Li> Supreme Court of Canada </Li> <Li> Veterans ' Bill of Rights <Ul> <Li> List of Supreme Court of Canada cases ( Dickson Court ) </Li> <Li> List of Supreme Court of Canada cases ( Lamer Court ) </Li> <Li> List of Supreme Court of Canada cases ( McLachlin Court ) </Li> </Ul> </Li> </Ul> <H2> References ( edit ) </H2> <Ol> <Li> Jump up ^ Only one federal law was declared inoperative by the Supreme Court of Canada : R. v.

He made his first appearance during `` A Hard Day 's Night '' , which was broadcast on March 27 , 2005 . Derek was married to Addison Montgomery ( Kate Walsh ) for 12 years , before their divorce in 2006 . Before his death in 2015 , Derek was happily married to his longtime girlfriend Meredith Grey ( Ellen Pompeo ) . The couple are often referred to as `` Mer & Der '' and they have three children together . Shepherd was formerly the Chief of Surgery at Seattle Grace Mercy West Hospital , but abruptly resigned as chief in season 7 following the shooting . For his portrayal of Shepherd , Dempsey was nominated in 2006 and 2007 Golden Globe for the Best Performance by an Actor in a Television Series Drama for the role , and the 2006 SAG Award for the Outstanding Performance by an Actor in a Drama Series award . </P> <P> </P> <H2> Contents </H2> ( hide ) <Ul> <Li> 1 Storyline </Li> <Li> 2 Development <Ul> <Li> 2.1 Casting and creation </Li> <Li> 2.2 Characterization </Li> </Ul> </Li> <Li> 3 Reception </Li> <Li> 4 References </Li> <Li> 5 External links </Li> </Ul> <P> </P> <H2> Storyline ( edit ) </H2> <P> Derek arrives at Seattle Grace Hospital as the new Head of Neurosurgery from New York City . He is a Bowdoin College graduate and attended Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons alongside his childhood best friend Mark Sloan and ex-wife Addison Montgomery and Private Practice characters Naomi Bennett and Sam Bennett . Derek was a student of Dr. Richard Webber and was enticed to come with an `` offer he could n't refuse '' -- the position of Chief of Surgery , which he eventually turned down . He specializes in highly complex tumors and conditions of the brain and spine and came to Seattle Grace with a reputation for taking on `` lost causes '' and `` impossible '' cases that most of his peers would turn down . As an attending he is both well - liked and feared -- well - liked by patients and his scrub nurses for his compassion and gentlemanly bedside manner and feared by interns and residents who are intimidated by his reputation and high standards . He is passionate about his job and has been known to expel staff or remove interns and residents ( or at least threaten them ) from his service for being disrespectful about patients or if he deems their attitude to be detrimental to his patient 's well - being . </P> <P> Derek first meets Meredith Grey at a bar , and soon finds out that she is an intern at Seattle Grace . They begin to have feelings for one another and it causes some awkwardness at work , particularly after her supervising resident Dr. Miranda Bailey discovers their relationship . Meredith 's housemates and fellow interns George O'Malley and Izzie Stevens both antagonized her for some time as they felt she was using her relationship with Derek to further her career . He generally tolerated them despite his dislike of sharing his living space with the interns who worked under him . While most of his family members accepted Meredith , his sister , Nancy , particularly disliked her and repeatedly called her `` the slutty intern '' ; as of season nine she still refuses to speak to Meredith or acknowledge her as her sister - in - law . His mother Carolyn approved as she felt Meredith 's gray perspective of life complemented Derek 's tendency to see everything in black and white . </P> <P> Derek 's background was generally a mystery for the first season and source of speculation amongst his colleagues due to his sudden departure from an established and highly respected practice in New York . In the season one finale , his past eventually catches up with him when his estranged wife Addison moves to Seattle and is offered a position by Dr. Webber . Shortly thereafter , his childhood best friend Mark joins Seattle Grace as the new head of plastic surgery . Derek and Addison attempt to repair their marriage but attempts were futile . Since their divorce they have remained on amicable terms , with Addison even admonishing Meredith for breaking up with Derek in season three . In the Private Practice episode `` Ex-Life '' Derek finally tells Addison that his mother never liked her in the first place . He admits to Meredith that Addison cheating on him with Mark was partly his fault as an absentee husband . Addison eventually leaves Seattle for a private practice in Los Angeles , spawning the spin - off Private Practice . In the season eight episode `` If / Then '' , Meredith dreams of an alternate universe where her mother never had Alzheimer 's ; Derek and Addison are still married but their strained relationship and Shepherd 's disillusionment causes his career to stagnate , earning him the nicknames `` Bad Shepherd '' and `` McDreary '' . </P> <P> When Derek is offered the Chief of Surgery position for the second time , he persuades the board to keep Dr. Webber on the staff . During the merger of Seattle Grace with Mercy West their relationship sours when Derek disagreed with Richard 's handling of the merger and Richard begins to display uncharacteristic behavior , not unnoticed by his fellow surgeons . Derek learns from Meredith that Richard has since resumed drinking and feels forced to have him removed as Chief of Surgery . With mixed feelings , Derek offers him an ultimatum : go into rehab and possibly pick up where he left off after , or quit completely . </P> <P> In seasons three and four , Meredith and Derek 's relationship becomes rocky and they each take time to date other people . Derek 's plans to propose were ruined by a series of unfortunate events in season five . In the season finale , they decide to give their planned wedding to Alex and Izzie . Due to their tight schedule , they instead informally marry and Derek writes down their `` promises '' on a post-it note . They legalize their marriage in season seven in order to adopt Zola , a young African orphan treated for spina bifida . They briefly separate after Meredith tampers with their Alzheimer 's trial , jeopardizing her career and tarnishing Derek 's reputation . Zola is taken away from Meredith after a social worker finds out she and Derek are living separately . In later seasons , Derek often griped about how his subsequent interns and residents -- mainly Lexie Grey , Shane Ross and Heather Brooks -- did not quite measure up to Meredith . The social worker comes back and announces they are the official parents of Zola . As Meredith nears the end of her fifth year of residency , she and Derek are torn between staying at Seattle Grace Mercy West or leaving for Boston where Derek would work at Harvard while Meredith would be at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital . </P> <P> Following his rescue from the plane crash that killed Mark and Lexie , Derek learns that he may only regain 80 percent of his hand 's function . He comes to terms with the fact that his career as a surgeon may be over and is grateful that he is alive . When Callie Torres ( Sara Ramirez ) , head of orthopedic surgery , tells him a more risky surgery could give him back full function of his hand or reduce its function if it goes wrong , he agrees , accepting the possibility of never again holding a scalpel . Derek recovers well and Callie clears him to return to work , but it is still weeks later that he feels ready to operate . Derek , Callie and fellow resident Jackson Avery decide to do nerve transplant for his hand . Meredith , newly pregnant with their second child , goes behind his back and calls his sisters so they can donate a nerve to him . Lizzie ( Neve Campbell ) , Derek 's younger sister , agrees to donate a nerve and the surgery is a success . </P> <P> Derek and Meredith 's marriage is strained after he accepted an invitation from the President to participate in the Brain - Mapping Initiative . He went back on his promise to her that he would not add to his current workload in order to devote time to their two young children and allow her the chance to establish her career as a full - fledged attending . Eventually he was offered a position at the National Institutes of Health in Washington , D.C. , but Meredith puts her foot down and refuses to leave her hometown and uproot their young family . His youngest sister Amelia ( Caterina Scorsone ) takes over his position at Grey Sloan . Meanwhile , he and Meredith fight bitterly on and off over whether they should move . After a bad argument , he accepts the job in the heat of the moment and leaves for Washington . While there , he and Meredith talk things out over the phone and come to a mutual conclusion that they both did not want to end their marriage . He tells her that just being with her , raising their children and operating on patients was more satisfying than `` saving the world '' . </P> <P> In season 11 , Derek is involved in a fatal car accident while driving to the airport for his final trip to Washington . He is able to hear and process auditory input , but unable to speak . He is recognized by Winnie , one of the victims of a crash he assisted in earlier , who tells the surgeons that their patient 's name is Derek and that he is a surgeon as well . The hospital he was taken to was understaffed and his head injury was not detected quickly enough by the interns on duty that night . Although the neurosurgeon on call is paged multiple times , he takes too long to arrive and Derek is declared brain dead . Police arrive at Meredith 's door and take her to see Derek , where she consents to removing him from life support . At the time of his death , Meredith was pregnant with their third child . She gives birth to a daughter whom she names Ellis after her mother . </P> <P> Derek was mentioned or referenced to a number of times in season 12 as the other characters struggle to cope with his sudden death . In the episode `` My Next Life '' , Meredith had a flashback of their first ever surgery together when a patient named Katie Bryce was admitted to the hospital with a brain aneurysm . Amelia took his death especially hard as he was the sibling she was closest to . At the end of the season , prior to her wedding to Derek 's long - time colleague Owen Hunt , Amelia goes on a nervous rant about how Derek was supposed to be the one to give her away , him having given away their three other sisters at their weddings . </P> <H2> Development ( edit ) </H2> <H3> Casting and creation ( edit ) </H3> <P> When Patrick Dempsey auditioned for the role of Derek Shepherd , he was afraid that he was not going to get the part . Creator Shonda Rhimes ' first reaction was : `` The very first time I met him , I was absolutely sure that he was my guy . Reading the lines of Derek Shepherd , Patrick had a vulnerable charm that I just fell for . And he had amazing chemistry with Ellen Pompeo . '' Rhimes admitted that Dempsey 's dyslexia threw her at first , particularly at the first few table readings : `` I did not know about Patrick 's dyslexia in the beginning . I actually thought that he did n't like the scripts from the way he approached the readings . When I found out , I completely understood his hesitation . Now that we all know , if he is struggling with a word , the other actors are quick to step up and help him out . Everyone is very respectful . '' Isaiah Washington also auditioned for the part and when he did not get it , he said his reaction was like `` I 'd been kicked in the stomach by 14 mules . '' Washington was , however , later cast as Preston Burke . Rob Lowe was also considered to portray Shepherd but turned the role down . Some of the character 's medical cases were inspired by real - life patients of Steve Giannotta , Chair of Neurological Surgery at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine , whom Rhimes had consulted in writing for Shepherd 's storylines and patients . </P> <P> In January 2014 , Dempsey signed a two - year contract to remain on Grey 's Anatomy ( then in its tenth season ) that would ensure his presence for potential 11th and 12th seasons . However , in April 2015 , Dempsey 's character was killed off while his contract was not over yet . Dempsey explained : `` it just sort of evolved . It 's just kind of happened . It really was something that was kind of surprising that unfolded , and it just naturally came to be . Which was pretty good . I like the way it has all played out . '' In August 2015 , Rhimes commented : </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> `` </Td> <Td> The decision to have the character die the way that he did was not a difficult one in the sense of what were the options ? Either Derek was going to walk out on Meredith , and leave her high and dry , and what was that going to mean ? That was going to suggest that the love was not true , the thing we had said for 11 years was a lie and McDreamy was n't McDreamy . For me , that was untenable . Meredith and Derek 's love had to remain Meredith and Derek 's love . As painful as it was for me as a storyteller , because I had never really thought that was going to happen , it preserved what felt true to me , was that Derek was going to have to die in order for that love to remain honest . Because I really could n't have the idea that he just turned out to be a bad guy who walked out on his wife and kids be a true story . To me , it felt like that was the only way to make Meredith and Derek 's magic remain true and forever frozen in time . </Td> <Td> '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> The character was later written to be a graduate of Bowdoin College , a liberal arts college in Brunswick , Maine , after an alumnus led a petition signed by over 450 students to `` adopt '' the character as an alumnus . Dempsey is from Lewiston , about 18 miles ( 29 km ) away from Brunswick , and was awarded an honorary doctorate by Bowdoin in 2013 . </P> <H3> Characterization ( edit ) </H3> <P> Rhimes describes Shepherd as typical `` Prince Charming '' . He was planned to be a doctor who does n't really care about anything , who lives in his `` own '' universe and has a big sex appeal . A man who is charming , devilishly handsome and the type of guy every girl dreams of , and a man that often makes the wrong decisions , and is often known as a jerk or the ultimate heartbreaker . Rhimes planned to have this kind of character from the beginning , because he was the kind of guy whom girls fall in love with and a character whose storylines could easily be changed . USA Today writer Robert Bianco said : `` Derek could , at times , seem like two people , warm and funny one minute , cold and self - involved the next . Dempsey 's gift was in making those two sides seem like part of the same person , while keeping us rooting for that person as a whole . '' </P> <H2> Reception ( edit ) </H2> Dempsey 's relation with Ellen Pompeo ( Meredith Grey ) has been the highlight of the series since its inception . <P> With the show concluding its second season , Robert Bianco of USA Today said that Emmy voters could consider him because of the `` seemingly effortless way he humanizes Derek 's ' dreamy ' appeal with ego and vanity '' . In the third season , Alan Sepinwall of The Star - Ledger wrote that `` the attempt to give the moral high ground back to McDreamy was bad . Dude , whatever happened in New York ceased to count in any kind of grievance tally once you agreed to take Addison back and give things another try . You 're the dick who cheated on her , you 're the one who knew that she found the panties , and still you act like her getting back together with Mark justifies what you did ? Wow . I did n't think it was possible for me to dislike anyone on this show more than Meredith , but congratulations , big guy . '' </P> <P> Debbie Chang of BuddyTV noted the character 's immaturity in the fourth season , saying : `` The only character who did not make me love him was Derek Shepherd ( Patrick Dempsey ) . How this character is still Shonda 's golden child is beyond me . Yes , we get it . He 's tormented by his love for Meredith , but that does not give him the right to lash out at her when his clinical trial patients are dying . If things do n't go absolutely the way he wants them to , then he refuses to cooperate . How immature can this man possibly be ? No amount of heavily styled hair or blue - blue - blue eyes is going to make me warm up to him unless he admits to being the needy , desperate one in the relationship . '' </P> <P> Entertainment Weekly placed Shepherd in its list of the `` 30 Great TV Doctors and Nurses '' . The character was also listed in Wetpaint 's `` 10 Hottest Male Doctors on TV '' and in BuzzFeed 's `` 16 Hottest Doctors On Television '' . His relationship with Meredith was included in TV Guide 's list of `` The Best TV Couples of All Time '' . </P> <P> Victor Balta of Today listed Shepherd and Sloan 's friendship in its `` TV 's best bromances '' . He called them `` the most exciting couple on Grey 's , '' explaining `` they 've demonstrated an easy chemistry that makes for some of the great comic relief around Seattle Grace Hospital with their banter , sage wisdom on each other 's lives , and locker room - style teasing . '' Their bromance was furthermore included in lists by About.com , BuddyTV , Cosmopolitan , Wetpaint . However , following the announcement of Dane 's upcoming departure from the show , Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald felt he and Derek `` never clicked like you 'd expect friends would . Any scene they had together ranged from uncomfortable to forced .

He lives in Brooklyn Heights , New York . Cliff had a brother , James Theodore Huxtable , who died of rheumatic fever at the age of 7 . In his high school and college years , he was an athlete who wrestled , played football , and ran track . He later served in the Navy before going to medical school . He is an OB / GYN who runs a practice from the office annexed to his home . In the show , most characters outside of family and friends refer to him as `` Dr. Huxtable '' , and he is well - respected in the community . </P> <P> Cliff is married to Clair Huxtable . Both Cliff and Clair attended the fictional Hillman College . Together , they have five children : Sondra , Denise , Theodore ( Theo ) , Vanessa , and Rudith ( Rudy ) . Cliff enjoys live jazz , has an extensive collection of albums , and tries to eat junk food whenever he can get away with it . </P> <P> Cliff is very eccentric and silly to most people around him , especially his family , however he is very kind - hearted and an extremely dedicated father with a strong sense of humor . Although he and his wife fostered a tight - knit , loving family , a running gag throughout the series is his thwarted attempts to get the grown children to leave the house . </P> <P> Very playful , Cliff enjoys competition , often making bets with Clair over various things , such as the date a certain jazz song was released , or having a `` Smooth Contest '' to see which of them looked more elegant for a night on the town , as judged by the children . He also plays a monthly game of pinochle against his father and some friends , which sometimes gets very passionate . Unfortunately , Cliff often finds himself on the losing end of most of his bets and games , as , for example , he has never beaten his father - in - law at chess . However , Cliff eventually broke his losing streak at pinochle against his father and his friend Homer Dobson with the help of Dr. Foster ( played by Roscoe Lee Browne ) , an expert pinochle player who also happened to be his and Clair 's literary professor at Hillman College . </P> <P> In the pilot episode , Cosby 's character 's full name is Clifford , as shown on a sign on the exterior of the house . His full name was subsequently changed to Heathcliff , even though in one episode Clair called him `` Heathclifford '' , and he is commonly called `` Cliff '' throughout the series . </P> <P> Originally , Cliff was to have worked as a chauffeur , with most of the humor coming from his interactions with customers . However , the show was changed before airing to have Cliff be a medical doctor , and the humor to come from his interactions with his family . </P> <P> Cliff also appears in three episodes of A Different World : the pilot ( with Rudy ) , `` Rudy and the Snow Queen '' ( also with Rudy ) and `` If Chosen , I May Not Run '' . </P> <P> He is the only character to appear in every episode . </P> <H3> Clair Huxtable </H3> Main article : Clair Huxtable <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Phylicia Rashād </Td> <Td> All </Td> <Td> 193 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Clair Olivia Huxtable ( née Hanks ) is the elegantly tough , eloquent , and engaging wife of Cliff , who is known for her relaxed confidence and striking emphasis as shown . Aside from her deep and decorated self - expression , Clair can also be playful and silly . She is an intelligent , classy , and successful businesswoman . A great debater , Clair rarely if ever loses an argument on the show , a testament to her career as lawyer . She is also highly skilled in areas of recall about facts and dates , which she uses during discussions and debates : in one episode she is shown quoting a passage and even the page number of a book during an appearance at a television roundtable . Clair is bilingual but is only shown speaking Spanish on a couple of occasions . Several episodes also showcased her singing talent . Despite her elegant brand of toughness and strictness , Clair is a very loving mother and wife . The character is loosely based upon Cosby 's wife , Camille Olivia Hanks - Cosby . </P> <P> Her age is directly stated only once during the series , and two separate episodes provide contradictory information on the age difference between herself and Cliff . He celebrates his 50th birthday during season three ( `` Cliff 's 50th Birthday '' ) , while she celebrates her 46th during season five ( `` Birthday Blues , '' two years later ) , indicating that she is six years younger . However , in the season four episode `` The Locker Room , '' it is stated that Clair is four years younger . </P> <P> Her character was originally supposed to be a housewife , but when the show finally aired , she became a lawyer . During the series , she becomes a partner in her law firm . As an attorney she helps her family with legal issues , and she successfully represents her eldest daughter , Sondra , in a case over dishonest car repairs . When it came to the Huxtable household , she was in charge , even though she let Cliff think he was in charge ( although Cliff was known to lay down the law when he had to ) . She was the chief disciplinarian of the children , as shown in an episode where Vanessa and her friends sneak off to Baltimore to see a rock concert and Clair delivers a memorable and scathing diatribe to her . Another memorable moment came when the normally composed Clair lost her temper when Sondra announced she was n't going to law school after paying her tuition to attend Princeton . </P> <P> Clair also appears in four episodes of A Different World : `` Clair 's Last Stand '' , `` Risky Business '' ( with Theo and Vanessa ) , `` Forever Hold Your Peace '' ( with Martin and Olivia ) and `` Success , Lies and Videotapes '' . </P> <P> Clair Huxtable has been ranked highly in several lists of the top television mothers . She was voted as television 's `` Favorite TV Mom '' in a poll conducted by the Opinion Research Company in 2004 . In 2009 , she was included in the Top 5 Classic TV Moms by Film.com . In May 2012 , Clair was one of the 12 moms chosen by users of iVillage on their list of `` Mommy Dearest : The TV Moms You Love '' . AOL named her the ninth Most Memorable Female TV Character . </P> <H3> Sondra Huxtable Tibideaux </H3> Main article : Sondra Huxtable -- Tibideaux <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> <Th> First appearance </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Sabrina LeBeauf </Td> <Td> 2 -- 8 ; recurring in 1 </Td> <Td> 53 </Td> <Td> `` Bonjour Sondra '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Sondra Tibideaux ( née Huxtable ) , the eldest daughter of Cliff and Clair , did not appear on screen until mid-way through season one . She did not exist in the pilot episode ( Clair : `` Why do we have four children ? '' Cliff : `` Because we did not want five . '' ) In her first appearance , she is a sophomore in college , and Cliff notes her to be 20 years old ( episode 10 ) , making her birth year 1964 . She earned a degree from Princeton University and had intentions of pursuing a career as a lawyer , like her mother . She married her boyfriend , Elvin Tibideaux , in season four , and later gave birth to twins -- a boy and a girl -- named after Nelson and Winnie Mandela . More serious , earnest and responsible than the other children , Sondra fits many of the characteristics of the first born from a large family . Though she had her moments of bizarre thinking ( e.g. dropping out of law school to open up a wilderness store with Elvin ) , she 'd usually snap out of them relatively quickly . Because of her intelligence level and overachieving nature , she is looked upon by her parents proudly , but also is held to a higher standard than the rest of the children . Sondra appeared sporadically in early seasons of the series due to the character being off at college at the time . </P> <P> Sondra was created when Bill Cosby wanted the show to express the accomplishment of successfully raising a child ( e.g. a college graduate ) . Whitney Houston was considered for the role of Sondra Huxtable . Sabrina LeBeauf almost missed out on the role because she is only 10 years younger ( b . 1958 ) than Phylicia Rashad ( b . 1948 ) . </P> <P> The character is loosely based upon Cosby 's eldest daughter , Erika , who was approximately the same age as Sondra . </P> <H3> Denise Huxtable Kendall </H3> Main article : Denise Huxtable -- Kendall <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> <Th> Final appearance </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Lisa Bonet </Td> <Td> 1 -- 3 , 6 -- 7 ; recurring in 4&5 </Td> <Td> 119 </Td> <Td> `` Cliff and Jake '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Denise Kendall ( née Huxtable ) is the second daughter of Cliff and Clair Huxtable . At the beginning of the series , she is sixteen years old , putting her year of birth in 1968 . She loves fashion and music , but did not want to attend school to pursue either interest . She is noted as being an individual who usually wishes to march to the beat of her own drum , and often learns lessons up front for herself rather than based off the experiences of others . A two - year stint at Hillman College ends with Denise wishing to see what she can accomplish on her own , which leads her to Africa as a photographer 's assistant . While there , she meets and marries Navy Lt. Martin Kendall , and also becomes stepmother to Martin 's three - year - old daughter Olivia , his child from a previous marriage . Denise eventually decides to become a special education teacher and makes arrangements to attend Medgar Evers College to this effect , but that idea does not work out as Denise eventually leaves New York again when Martin is posted to Singapore on a long - term assignment . It is revealed in the series finale that she is pregnant . </P> <P> During the first two seasons , Denise was portrayed as a very popular high - schooler , with many friends , who seemingly had a different boyfriend every episode . Along with her constantly fluctuating love life , were her various hairstyles and choices of clothing , which were occasionally made fun of by Cliff . In later seasons , however , she exhibited a more flighty nature , often expressing ideas that left Cliff and Clair greatly puzzled . </P> <P> In season three , Denise left home to attend Hillman College , a fictional , historically African - American college , of which her mother , father and grandfather were all alumni . The Cosby Show 's producers created a spin - off series , entitled A Different World , which initially dealt with the life of Denise at college . Denise was written out of the series following its inaugural season ( which aired concurrently with season four of The Cosby Show ) , after actress Lisa Bonet became pregnant . Shortly after the start of season five , Denise traveled to Africa for a year , and there she fell in love with and married Martin . In the season six premiere , she returned home , shocking her parents with the news of her surprise marriage to a divorced single father . However , Cliff and Clair accepted the couple when they met Olivia , who immediately won their hearts and was welcomed into the family . She appears regularly during the first three seasons , and is in only four episodes each of seasons four and five ( a picture of her can be seen in the opening credits of season four ) , she appears regularly in season six , but only appears in a handful of episodes during season seven . </P> <P> The character is loosely based upon Cosby 's daughter , Erinn , who was approximately the same age as Denise . Additionally , Denise attended Hillman College , whereas Erinn attended Spelman College , the university that Hillman is believed to be modeled after . </P> <H3> Theo Huxtable </H3> Main article : Theodore Huxtable <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Malcolm - Jamal Warner </Td> <Td> All </Td> <Td> 176 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Theodore Aloysius `` Theo '' Huxtable is the middle child and only son of Cliff and Clair Huxtable , and is athletic and obsessed with impressing girls , and obtaining a sports car or motorcycle . He is fourteen years old when the series begins , making his birth year 1970 . In the pilot episode , he is lectured by his father for not applying himself at school ( `` I brought you in this world , and I 'll take you out '' ) . Also in the early seasons , he was somewhat of a troublemaker , as illustrated through incidents both alluded to and explicitly portrayed in the series , such as letting his best friend 's younger sister pierce his ear , resulting in an infected earlobe , but his behavior had improved by the time he left high school . </P> <P> A running theme of the early seasons revolved around Theo 's academic struggles , especially in his sophomore - year geometry class , taught by Mrs. Westlake ( Sonia Braga ) . As the seasons progressed , Theo gradually evolved from being an under - achiever to a successful high school -- and college -- student ( in interviews , Cosby noted a similar change in his real - life son , Ennis ) . While Theo was a student at NYU , it was revealed that he suffered from dyslexia , a learning disability that inspired him to work harder , and as a result overcame it . By the final season , Theo was a student teacher , helping other children with dyslexia at a local education center . In the show 's final episode , he graduated from NYU with a degree in psychology . </P> <P> In the pilot , and once more in season one ( the episode `` Bad Dreams '' ) , he is referred to by Vanessa as `` Teddy '' , instead of `` Theo . '' </P> <P> Theo has a long - running , but on - and - off relationship with a girl named Justine , who is mentioned many times throughout the series , but appears in only nine episodes . During his high school years , Theo 's best friend was Walter Bradley ( Carl Anthony Payne II ) , better known as `` Cockroach '' , who was more of a scholastic underachiever than Theo . The two of them would occasionally compose rap songs for various school assignments . When Theo got tickets to `` Dance Mania '' ( a `` Soul Train '' - like television dance show ) , and only one of them was allowed into the studio , Theo let Cockroach have the spot , but did not feel good about it when he saw Cockroach on TV , and as the center of their friends ' attention the next day at school . This episode marked the final appearance of the character , and Cockroach was rarely mentioned in subsequent episodes . Theo appears in the series the most out of the Huxtable children . </P> <P> The character is loosely based upon Cosby 's only son Ennis , who was approximately the same age as Theo ( and was also dyslexic ) . </P> <P> Theo also appears in two episodes of A Different World : `` My Dinner With Theo '' ( with Rudy ) and `` Risky Business '' ( with Clair and Vanessa ) . </P> <H3> Vanessa Huxtable </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Tempestt Bledsoe </Td> <Td> All </Td> <Td> 157 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Vanessa Huxtable is the fourth child and third daughter of Cliff and Clair . In season one , she is eleven years old , making her birth year 1973 . As Vanessa grew up , she faced typical teenage problems and heartbreaks , such as wearing make - up before her 15th birthday in violation of her parents ' rules and spending a lot of time talking on the phone with her friends . Unlike her older brother , she was an excellent student and seemed to enjoy school ; at the beginning of season seven , she went off to college one year early . She became engaged in the final season to Dabnis Brickey , a man in his late twenties . Dabnis was the head of maintenance at Lincoln University in Pennsylvania , where Vanessa was enrolled . However , Vanessa realized that she was not ready to get married , and they broke off the engagement . They maintained they were `` just friends '' by the end of the season . </P> <P> In the early seasons , Vanessa is usually considered to be nosy , as she usually -- sneakily -- tries to find out what goes on in the Huxtable house , especially when it involves someone ( usually Theo ) in trouble with their parents . But , in a later episode , the tables are turned , as Theo catches Vanessa 's friends smoking cigarettes in her room , although Vanessa herself did not take part , and even tried to dissuade her friends from doing so . </P> <P> She often fought with her younger sister , Rudy , over typical childish issues . At one point , their fighting caused damage to both their bedrooms and the kitchen ceiling , driving Cliff to declare their rooms off limits because of `` World War Five '' and exile them to the basement until repairs were finished . But , on one occasion , Vanessa got into a physical tussle with Denise over a sweater that Vanessa stole from Denise 's closet after Denise did not allow her to borrow it . </P> <P> One of Vanessa 's best friends in high school was a girl named Kara ( played by Elizabeth Narvaez ) , who could ramble on about nothing in particular at high speed . Whenever Cliff -- who once referred to Kara as `` Turbo Tongue '' -- was on the receiving end of her babbling , he would always reply with a bewildered `` Thank you . '' Vanessa appeared sporadically in the final two seasons of the series due to the character being away at college . </P> <P> The character is loosely based upon Cosby 's daughter , Ensa , who was approximately the same age as Vanessa . </P> <P> Vanessa also appears in the A Different World episode `` Risky Business '' ( with Clair and Theo ) . </P> <H3> Rudy Huxtable </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Keshia Knight Pulliam </Td> <Td> All </Td> <Td> 177 </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Rudith Lillian `` Rudy '' Huxtable is the youngest of the Huxtable children . She is only five years old at the beginning of the series , making her birth year 1979 . She comes of age during the course of the show . </P> <P> A number of Rudy 's friends appear in episodes as the series progresses . Among the best known are the taciturn Peter Chiara who repeatedly ran out the Huxtables ' front door when frightened ; and the chauvinist , blues - loving Kenny , whom she nicknames `` Bud '' , and who always gets advice from his ( unseen ) older brother about basically everything . This unfortunately gives him the wrong conception about certain things and gets him in trouble , although he seemed to grow out of it as the series reached its end . </P> <P> Keshia Knight Pulliam was nominated for an Emmy for her performance in season two , becoming the youngest nominee ever . One of her fellow nominees that year was Phylicia Rashad . Neither won . </P> <P> The Huxtable family was originally going to be two boys and two girls . The youngest child , Rudy , was initially supposed to be a boy , but the character was re-written for a girl ( Keshia Knight Pulliam ) when no boys auditioned . Jaleel White , later known for his role as Steve Urkel on Family Matters , revealed in a 2011 interview with Vanity Fair that he had auditioned for the role of Rudy . </P> <P> The character is loosely based upon Cosby 's youngest daughter , Evin , who was approximately the same age as Rudy . </P> <P> Rudy also appears in three episodes of A Different World : the pilot ( with Cliff ) , `` Rudy and the Snow Queen '' ( also with Cliff ) and `` My Dinner with Theo '' ( with Theo ) . </P> <H3> Elvin Tibideaux </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> <Th> First appearance </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Geoffrey Owens </Td> <Td> 4 -- 8 ; recurring in 2&3 </Td> <Td> 44 </Td> <Td> `` Cliff in Love '' </Td> </Tr> </Table> <P> Elvin Tibideaux is Sondra 's boyfriend , and later , husband . They met at Princeton , where they both earned degrees . The two constantly bickered during early episodes , until his interactions with the Huxtables , particularly Clair , challenged him to confront his `` male - chauvinist '' attitudes . </P> <P> When they return from their honeymoon , they shock Cliff and Clair by announcing their intentions to forego medical school and law school , and start a wilderness supply store in Brooklyn . When his children are born , Elvin then announces that he will re-apply to medical school . This decision later convinces Sondra to resume her studies at law school . </P> <P> Elvin was a wrestler in high school and for one year at Princeton , but had to quit after injuring his hip . During season three , he helped Theo with some strategy and moves . </P> <H3> Martin Kendall </H3> <Table> <Tr> <Th> Portrayed by </Th> <Th> Seasons </Th> <Th> No. of episodes </Th> <Th> First appearance </Th> </Tr> <Tr> <Td> Joseph C.

Martin Kendall is a Navy officer , husband of Denise Huxtable , and father of Olivia . Phillips ' role as Martin Kendall came about when Denise unexpectedly married him in Africa , unbeknownst to her parents and family . When the newlyweds arrive back home , Martin learns that Denise 's family not only does not know about their marriage , they do not know about him at all , so he wants to introduce himself to the Huxtables now that he has married into their family and to show his intentions of marrying his daughter were honorable . This does not go over smoothly at first , as Clair and Cliff are uneasy with the whirlwind marriage of Martin , however in due time they become accustomed to this blended family . Kendall also had an ex-wife , named Paula ( played by Victoria Rowell of The Young and the Restless ) . In the finale , it is revealed that he and Denise are expecting a baby together . </P> <P> Joseph C. Phillips played Sondra 's date in a season two episode , before coming back as a new character , and playing the husband of Denise . Martin appears frequently in the sixth season but is only seen in a handful episodes of the seventh season , Joseph C. Phillips 's final season as a regular .

Olivia was then raised by her grandparents and father . </P> <P> When Olivia was almost four years old , her father Martin married Denise Huxtable , whom he met in Africa .
