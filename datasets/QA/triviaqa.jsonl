{"context": "\nBilly Cotton\nWilliam Edward \"Billy\" Cotton (6 May 1899 \u2013 25 March 1969) was an English band leader and entertainer, one of the few whose orchestras survived the British dance band era. Cotton is now mainly remembered as a 1950s and 1960s radio and television personality, but his musical career had begun in the 1920s. In his younger years Billy Cotton was also an amateur footballer for Brentford F.C. (and later, for the then Athenian league club Wimbledon F.C.), an accomplished racing driver and the owner of a Gipsy Moth, which he piloted himself. His autobiography, \"I Did It My Way\", was published in 1970, a year after his death.\n\nLife and career\n\nBorn in Smith Square, London, to Joseph and Susan Cotton, Cotton was a choirboy and started his musical career as a drummer. He enlisted in the Royal Fusiliers by falsifying his age and saw service in World War I in Malta and Egypt, before landing at Gallipoli in the middle of an artillery barrage. He was recommended for a commission and learned to fly Bristol Fighter aircraft. He flew solo for the first time in 1918, on the day the Royal Flying Corps became the Royal Air Force. He was not yet 19 years old. In the early 1920s, he worked at several jobs, including as a bus driver, before setting up his own orchestra, the London Savannah Band, in 1924.\n\nAt first a conventional dance band, the London Savannah Band gradually tended towards music hall/vaudeville entertainment, introducing visual and verbal humour in between songs. Famous musicians who played in Billy Cotton's band during the 1920s and 1930s included Arthur Rosebery, Syd Lipton and Nat Gonella. The band was also noted for their African American trombonist and tap dancer, Ellis Jackson. Their signature tune was \"Somebody Stole My Gal\", and they made numerous commercial recordings for Decca.\n\nDuring the Second World War Cotton and his band toured France with the Entertainments National Service Association (ENSA). After the war, he started his successful Sunday lunchtime radio show on BBC, the Billy Cotton Band Show, which ran from 1949 to 1968. In the 1950s, composer Lionel Bart contributed comedy songs to the show.  It regularly opened with the band's signature tune and Cotton's call of \"Wakey Wakey\". From 1957, it was also broadcast on BBC television. Cotton often also provided vocals on many of his bands recordings and was also a vocalist on recordings that didn't feature his band.\n\nAs a racing driver, his finest moment came in 1949 when he finished fourth in the 1949 British Grand Prix, sharing an ERA with David Hampshire.\n\nCotton married Mabel E. Gregory in 1921. They had two sons, Ted and Sir Bill Cotton, who later became the BBC's managing director of television. In 1962 Billy Cotton suffered a stroke. He died in 1969 while watching a boxing match at Wembley.\n\nBilly Cotton was the great-great-uncle of TV & Radio Presenter Fearne Cotton.\n\nSelected filmography\n\n* The First Mrs. Fraser (1932)\n* Variety (1935)\n\nBibliography\n\n* I Did It My Way, Autobiography, 1970, Publisher: George G.

{"context": "\nBellini (cocktail)\nA Bellini cocktail is a mixture of Prosecco sparkling wine and peach pur\u00e9e or nectar. This cocktail originated in Venice, Italy.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Bellini was invented sometime between 1934 and 1948    by Giuseppe Cipriani, founder of Harry's Bar in Venice, Italy. He named the drink the Bellini because its unique pink color reminded him of the toga of a saint in a painting by 15th-century Venetian artist Giovanni Bellini. \n\nThe drink started as a seasonal specialty at Harry's Bar, a favorite haunt of Ernest Hemingway, Sinclair Lewis and Orson Welles. Later, it also became popular at the bar's New York counterpart. After an entrepreneurial Frenchman set up a business to ship fresh white peach pur\u00e9e to both locations, it became a year-round favorite.\n\nThe Bellini is an IBA Official Cocktail. They also suggest a Puccini, replacing the peach pur\u00e9e with an equal amount of mandarin juice, a Rossini, which uses strawberry pur\u00e9e, or a Tintoretto, which is made with pomegranate juice.\n\nPreparation and serving\n\nThe Bellini consists of pur\u00e9ed white peaches and Prosecco, an Italian sparkling wine. Marinating fresh peaches in wine is an Italian tradition. The original recipe was made with a bit of raspberry or cherry juice to give the drink a pink glow. Due, in part, to the limited availability of both white peaches and Prosecco, several variations exist.\n\nCalifornia produces a white peach that works well,  and yellow peaches or peach nectar can be substituted, especially if peaches are out of season and the flavor would be very bland. Other fruits or even flavoured liqueurs (peach schnapps, for example) are sometimes substituted for the peach pur\u00e9e.\n\nThe Cipriani family produces Bellini Base  for the signature cocktail of the Harry's Bar restaurants.\n\nOther sparkling wines are commonly used in place of Prosecco, though richly flavored French champagne does not pair well with the light, fruity flavor of the Bellini. For a non-alcoholic version, sparkling juice or seltzer is used in place of the wine.\n", "context_len": 377, "questions": ["Which fruit juice is added to champagne to make a Bellini cocktail?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Gordon Jackson (disambiguation)", "GORDON JACKSON", "Gordon Jackson", "Jackson, Gordon"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

While in custody, the men of the court use him to further their own romantic endeavors.  By sending love notes to the wrong women and blurting out secrets (including that of an unplanned pregnancy), Costard makes fools of the royal court.  Along with Moth the page and Jaquenetta, a country wench, Costard pokes fun at the upper-class.  While mocking a pedantic schoolmaster, Costard uses the word honorificabilitudinitatibus, the longest word by far from any of Shakespeare's works.\n\nCostard makes many clever puns, and is used as a tool by Shakespeare to explain new words such as remuneration. He is sometimes considered one of the smartest characters in the play due to his wit and wordplay.\n\nCostard's name is an archaic term for apple, or metaphorically a man's head.

{"context": "\nTurn on, tune in, drop out\n\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" is a counterculture-era phrase popularized by Timothy Leary in 1966. In 1967 Leary spoke at the Human Be-In, a gathering of 30,000 hippies in Golden Gate Park in San Francisco and phrased the famous words, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\". It was also the title of his spoken word album Turn On, Tune In, Drop Out recorded in 1966. On this lengthy album one can hear Leary speaking in a monotone, soft-spoken voice on his views about the world and humanity and describing nature, Indian symbols, \"the meaning of inner life\", the LSD experience, peace and many other issues.\n\nIn a 1988 interview with Neil Strauss, Leary stated that slogan was \"given to him\" by Marshall McLuhan during a lunch in New York City. Leary added that McLuhan \"was very much interested in ideas and marketing, and he started singing something like, 'Psychedelics hit the spot / Five hundred micrograms, that's a lot,' to the tune of a Pepsi commercial of the time. Then he started going, 'Tune in, turn on, and drop out.  The phrase was used by Leary in a speech he delivered at the opening of a press conference in New York City on September 19, 1966. It urged people to embrace cultural changes through the use of psychedelics by detaching themselves from the existing conventions and hierarchies in society. It was also the motto of his League for Spiritual Discovery.  The phrase was derided by more conservative critics.\n\nIn his speech, Leary stated:\n\nLeary later explained in his 1983 autobiography Flashbacks:\n\nTurn on, tune in, drop out is also the title of a book (ISBN 1-57951-009-4) of essays by Timothy Leary, covering topics ranging from religion, education, and politics to Aldous Huxley, neurology, and psychedelic drugs.\n\nLeary later (during the February 1967 salon known as the Houseboat Summit) announced his agreement with a new ordering of the phrase as he said, \"I would agree to change the slogan to 'Drop out. Turn on. Drop in.'\" \n\nDuring his last decade, Leary proclaimed that the \"PC is the LSD of the 1990s\" \u2014 \"turn on, boot up, jack in\" reworked the existing phrase to suggest joining the cyberdelic counterculture. \n\nThe phrase was referenced in several songs of the time. Psychedelic rock band Strawberry Alarm Clock parodies the quote in their 1967 song \"Incense and Peppermints\", singing \"Turn on, tune in, turn your eyes around\" in one of the lines. Gil Scott-Heron criticised the concept in his 1970 poem and song The Revolution Will Not Be Televised, with the line \"You will not be able to plug in, turn on and \".\n\nThe lyrics, \"Turn on, tune in, drop out\" are included verbatim in several songs:\n*\"Turn On, Tune In\" by Threshold\n*\"Drop Out\" by Infected Mushroom\n*\"Turn On Tune In Drop Out\" by Cracker\n*\"Turn on, Tune in, Stay inert\" in \"Flash Delerium\" by MGMT\n*\"Turn On / Tune In / Drop Out\" on The Fugs' album Tenderness Junction\n* \"Tune In, Drop Out\" in \"Trigger Hippie\" by Morcheeba\n\nThe CSI episode title \"Turn On, Tune In, Drop Dead\" also parodies the quote, with the episode focusing on how two victims who are supposedly dead get up and walk away.\n\nA variation of the quote (\"Tune in, Turn on, Talknet\")  was used in the 1980s and early 1990s for NBC Radio's Talknet nighttime programming block of call-in advice shows.\n", "context_len": 709, "questions": ["\"Who was the American writer and counterculture icon who coined the phrase \"\"Turn on, tune in, drop out\"\"?\""], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["1850s", "1850\u20131859", "1850's", "1850-1859", "Eighteen-fifties"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

The huge land tract\u2014the Louisiana Purchase\u2014would later form all or parts of 15 states and two Canadian provinces.\u00a0\nBut the cities and towns inside Louisiana have some interesting stories behind their names as well.\nNew Orleans was founded in 1718 as Nouvelle-Orl\u00e9ans by the French explorer Bienville. He named the city in honor of another French official, then Prince Regent of France Philip II, Duke of Orleans.\nLouisiana\u2019s capital city, Baton Rouge , means \u201cred stick\u201d in French. The red stick refers to a blood-stained pole French explorer Iberville found on the bank of the Mississippi River in 1699 at the city\u2019s present location. I\u2019ve heard conflicting stories throughout the years about the stick\u2019s purpose. I\u2019ve heard it was a dividing line between lands occupied and hunted by the Bayougoula and Houma Native American tribes in south Louisiana, but I\u2019ve also heard it was possibly placed to mark the passing of a respected tribal elder. Either way, the stick was placed by the Native Americans.\nOn a related note, several Louisiana cities owe their names to Louisiana\u2019s first residents including Bayou Goula, Houma , Natchitoches , Opelousas , Coushatta , Jena and Ponchatoula .\nShreveport\u2019s name is tied to a 160-mile log jam on the Red River in northwest and central Louisiana in the early 1800s. A steamboat captain and hundreds of men under his command successfully cleared the log jam opening river navigation southward to the Mississippi River. They established a port community north of the jam named for the jam-clearing captain\u2014Henry Miller Shreve.\nLafayette was originally named Vermilionville, for the Cajun community that formed on Bayou Vermilion in the late 1700s. In the early 1800s, locals wanted to rename the small town to recognize the Marquis de Lafayette. The Frenchman aided the U.S. in the Revolutionary War and was subsequently invited on a multi-state tour in his honor as then-President James Monroe celebrated the nation\u2019s 50-year anniversary. It is said many towns visited by Lafayette during the tour were renamed in his honor, but it\u2019s also said Lafayette\u2019s tour didn\u2019t include the present day Louisiana namesake.\nSpeaking of President Monroe, the Louisiana city of Monroe is indirectly named in his honor. The then-young outpost took its name from the James Monroe, a steam-powered paddle wheeler that visited via the Ouachita River in 1819 and showed locals the river could transform the outpost into a bustling town.\nLike other U.S. states, Louisiana has places named for city founders (examples include Alexandria , Berwick and Hammond ) and for nearby natural resources, such as Louisiana\u2019s Lake Charles , Lake Providence and Lake Arthur .\nLouisiana even has one central Louisiana 1800s sawmill town named for a defective natural resource.

Newspapers have reported that Berlusconi told police that a local party official would take custody of the girl, who had visited Berlusconi's Milan villa on at least one occasion.\nEven center-right commentators in Berlusconi's family-owned newspapers have criticized him for intervening in a possible criminal case. Berlusconi's now-estranged ally, Gianfranco Fini, said his antics had embarrassed the country.\nBut Berlusconi again defended his lifestyle and fondness for young women, telling a trade fair in Milan on Tuesday it was \"better to be passionate about a beautiful girl than a gay.\"\nGay rights group Arcigay demanded an apology for causing offense to both women and gays. Later, about two dozen people holding signs with a photo of Berlusconi and denouncing homophobia demonstrated across the street from the premier's office.\nThe premier's comments \"represent a dangerous incitement to prejudice and helps legitimize discrimination, injustice and suffering,\" Arcigay president Paolo Pantane wrote in a letter to Berlusconi's minister for equal opportunity, Mara Carfagna.\nIn response, Carfagna defended Berlusconi's record on anti-discrimination measures and said he had just been joking.\n\"(He) absolutely never intended to offend women or homosexuals,\" she said.\nAnother prominent supporter, Daniela Santanche, a government undersecretary, also rallied to the premier's defense, saying there was nothing disturbing in his comment.\nAfter noting that she \"esteems homosexuals,\" Santanche said: \"I am sure that all Italian parents hope to have heterosexual children.\"\nShe added that \"the hope of every mother is to some day become a grandmother and have their children avoid the problems of a life inherent in the homosexual condition,\" the Italian news agency ANSA quoted her as saying.\nBerlusconi assured supporters on Tuesday that his government still had a majority and would last the remaining half of its five-year term. He said early elections would be a disaster for a country grappling with economic crisis.\nHe contended that the Ruby scandal was whipped up by hostile, deceptive newspapers and again defended his decision to intervene in her case. Ruby was let go by police with no charges after Nicole Minetti, a party official who is also Berlusconi's dental hygienist, took custody of her.\nBerlusconi said Tuesday he'd do the same thing again.\n\"You will see when this is over that there was nothing more than an act of solidarity,\" he said.\nRuby, meanwhile, told Libero, a conservative newspaper close to Berlusconi, that she would tell her version of the story Thursday on a popular state-run TV talk show, but her lawyer later said there were no such plans. Ruby's comments have been inconsistent and prosecutors have reportedly questioned her credibility.\nShe repeated she never had intimate relations with the premier, though she said she \"adored\" him. She clarified that while another young woman linked to Berlusconi, Noemi Letizia, referred to him as \"papi\" (\"daddy\"), she called him \"premier.\"\nBerlusconi's relationship with Letizia, an 18-year-old would-be model from Naples, sparked a scandal last year that prompted Berlusconi's second wife to file for divorce.\nSoon after, a high-end prostitute, Patrizia D'Addario, claimed she had spent a night with the premier and had tape recorded their encounter.\nThe conservative leader has said he has never paid anyone for sex.

{"context": "\nKing's Road\nKing's Road or Kings Road (or sometimes The King's Road, especially when it was the King's private road until 1830), is a major street stretching through Chelsea and Fulham, both in west London. It is associated with 1960s style, and fashion figures such as Mary Quant and Vivienne Westwood. Sir Oswald Mosley's Blackshirt movement had a barracks on the street in the 1930s. \n\nLocation\n\nKing's Road  runs for just under 2 mi through Chelsea, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, from Sloane Square in the east (on the border with Belgravia and Knightsbridge) and through the Moore Park estate on the border of Chelsea and Fulham opposite Stamford Bridge. Shortly after crossing Stanley bridge the road passes a slight kink at the junction with Waterford Road in Fulham, where it then becomes New King's Road, continuing to Fulham High Street and Putney Bridge; its western end is in the London Borough of Hammersmith and Fulham.\n\nHistory\n\nKing's Road derives its name from its function as a private road used by King Charles II to travel to Kew. It remained a private royal road until 1830, but people with connections were able to use it. Some houses date from the early 18th century. No. 213 has a blue plaque to film director Sir Carol Reed, who lived there from 1948 until his death in 1978. Thomas Arne lived at No. 215 and is believed to have composed \"Rule Britannia\" there. Ellen Terry lived in the same house from 1904\u20131920, and also Peter Ustinov; the house is commemorated by a blue plaque also. Photographer Christina Broom was born in 1862 at No 8.\n\nIn 1876, the world's first artificial ice rink, the Glaciarium, opened just off King's Road, and later that year it relocated to a building on the street.\n\nDuring the 1960s the street became a symbol of mod culture, evoking \"an endless frieze of mini-skirted, booted, fair-haired angular angels\", one magazine later wrote.  King's Road was home in the 1960s to the Chelsea Drugstore (originally a chemist with a stylised chrome-and-neon soda fountain upstairs, later a public house, and more recently a McDonalds), and in the 1970s  to Malcolm McLaren's boutique, Let It Rock, which was renamed SEX in 1974, and then Seditionaries in 1977. During the hippie and punk eras, it was a centre for counterculture, but has since been gentrified. It serves as Chelsea's high street and has a reputation for being one of London's most fashionable shopping streets.  Other celebrated boutiques included Granny Takes a Trip, The Sweet Shop in Blantyre Street just off King's Road at World's End and Stop The Shop, a fashion boutique with a revolving floor.\n\n484 King's Road was the headquarters of Swan Song Records, owned by Led Zeppelin.  They left following closure of the company in 1983. King's Road was site of the first UK branch of Starbucks which opened in 1999.\n\n535 King's Road was the headquarters of Cube Records, a late 1960s and early 1970s independent record label. The label folded in the mid 1970s, becoming part of Elektra Records. The building has since been demolished but the new building on the same site still houses a record company.\n\nThe road has been represented in popular culture on various occasions: \"King's Road\" is the title of a song by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers from the 1981 album Hard Promises and is name-checked in the song \"Dick a Dum Dum (King's Road)\" which was a hit for Des O'Connor in 1969. In Ian Fleming's novels, James Bond lives in a fashionable unnamed square just off King's Road.\n\nPlanning and transport\n\n;Planning\nThe eastern part of King's Road is identified in the London Plan as one of 35 major centres in Greater London.\n\n;Bus\nBuses 11, 19, 22, 49, 211, 319, 328, and C3 all go down King's Road, yet most of these turn off the street at one point or another. The 11 and the 22 are the only routes which run the entirety of King's Road, with the 22 being the only route that runs all the way from Sloane Square to the end of New King's Road in Fulham.\n\n;Rail and Tube\nThe western end of King's Road is close to Imperial Wharf railway station on the London Overground network, with connections to Willesden Junction and Clapham Junction. Southern also run direct rail services to  and  from this station. At the eastern end of the street is Sloane Square, and Fulham Broadway lies at the western end, on the boundary between Chelsea and Fulham.

He founded Thomas Minton & Sons in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, which grew into a major ceramic manufacturing company with an international reputation.\n\nDuring the early 1780s Thomas Minton was an apprentice engraver at the Caughley Pottery Works in Shropshire, under the proprietorship of Thomas Turner, working on copperplate engravings for the production of transferware.  The engraver Thomas Lucas went from there to work for Josiah Spode at Stoke-on-Trent in 1783, taking some elements of the fashionable chinoiserie patterns with him.  While at Caughley Thomas Minton is thought to have worked on chinoiserie landscape patterns including willows, and to have prepared copperplates of them:  but the Salopian works never produced the standard willow pattern which includes the bridge and the fence in the foreground.  \n\nMinton left the Salopian works in 1785, and married Sarah in London in 1789. In 1793 he established his own pottery factory in Stoke-upon-Trent principally for the manufacture of white-glazed earthen tablewares or pearlware including blue transfer printed and painted wares. Variations of his willow and other designs were acquired by Spode and other factories, and it was in this context that the English willow pattern was created. He was favoured and employed by Josiah Spode, for whom he engraved a new version of the pattern. To Minton is also attributed the popular 'Buffalo' pattern engraved for Spode.  He was assisted by Henry Doncaster of Penkhull: his pupil William Greatbatch (father of William Greatbatch (1802-1885), another notable engraver) became chief engraver for Spode and for the successor company, Copeland's.  \n\nIn c. 1796 Minton went into partnership with Joseph Poulson, who produced ornamental bone china at a factory nearby, and from c.1798 Minton employed Poulson's factory for his own china wares. After Poulson's death in 1808 he continued china production there until 1816. In 1824 he built a new factory for china, on the basis of which the company of 'Thomas Minton and Sons', known more simply as 'Mintons', was developed. At his death in 1836 his son Herbert Minton (1793-1858) continued and redeveloped the business.\n\nHis portrait was made by James Northcote, R.A..\n\nSources\n", "context_len": 406, "questions": ["Thomas Minton at Stoke on Trent created what in 1789?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["2", "Two", "two"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

The Reversing Falls of St. John are located on a gorge that leads into the Bay of Fundy. At low tide, the water from the gorge comes cascading down on its way to the bay. At high tide, however, which in this part of the world is excessive, the bay's water level rises 5 feet higher than that of the river itself.

The film, in common with the original stage play, follows the schoolmaster's final few days in his post, as he comes to terms with his sense of failure as a teacher, a sense of weakness exacerbated by his wife's infidelity and the realization that he is despised by both pupils and staff of the school.\n\nThe emotional turning-point for the cold Crocker-Harris is his pupil Taplow's unexpected parting gift, Robert Browning's translation of the Agamemnon, which he has inscribed with the Greek phrase that translates as \"God from afar looks graciously upon a gentle master.\"\n\nDifferences between play and film\n\nRattigan extends the screenplay far from his own one-act play, which ends on Crocker-Harris's tearful reaction to Taplow's gift. Therefore, the play ends well before Crocker-Harris's farewell speech to the school; the film shows the speech, in which he discards his notes and admits his failings, to be received with warm applause and cheers by the boys.

{"context": "\nTake Your Pick!\nTake Your Pick! was a United Kingdom game show originally broadcast by Radio Luxembourg in the early 1950s. The show transferred to television in 1955 with the launch of ITV, where it continued until 1968. As it was the first game show broadcast on commercial television in the UK (and the BBC did not at that point offer monetary prizes on its game shows), it was also by default the first British game show to offer cash prizes.The programme was later revived from 24 February 1992 to 28 August 1998.\n\nHistory\n\nThe first television version was produced by Associated-Rediffusion (later Rediffusion London), while the revival was made by Thames Television (whose arrival as the new London weekday ITV company had led to the original show's demise).\n\nIf they got through the \"Yes-No Interlude\" (in which they had to answer a series of questions without using the words \"yes\" or \"no\" or be gonged off the stage), contestants would answer questions to win modest monetary prizes and at the climax of the show had to decide whether to \"take the money\" or \"open the box\". The box could contain good prizes (for the time), such as a holiday or a washing machine, but could also contain booby prizes such as a mousetrap or a bag of sweets.\n\nThe first version was hosted by Michael Miles (after its demise, Miles hosted a similar show for Southern Television called Wheel of Fortune, not to be confused with the later Wheel of Fortune of the same title). Bob Danvers-Walker, the voice of Path\u00e9 News from 1940 until its demise in 1970, was the show's announcer, and Alec Dane was on hand to bang the gong. At the electronic organ was Harold Smart.\n\nDes O'Connor became the host for the second version in the 1990s. His future wife Jodie Wilson was one of the hostesses; she would later be replaced by Neighbours twins Gayle and Gillian Blakeney.\n\nIt was revived again for one night only as part of Ant & Dec's Gameshow Marathon in 2005, a series of the Geordie duo presenting classic ITV gameshows as part of the channel's 50th anniversary in their own style.\n\nA similar formula was used for Pot of Gold, another game show, hosted by O'Connor.\n\nThe Des O'Connor series is currently being repeated on Challenge.\n\nThe game was played during the ninth series of Britain's Got More Talent.\n\nYes/No interlude\n\nIn this opening game, the host asked the contestant a series of questions for 60 seconds and the contestant could not say yes, no, nod or shake their heads. If they did, the co-host would bang the gong and the contestant would be eliminated (unless other contestants did the same).\n\nBox numbers and the prizes\n\nThere were 10 boxes numbered from 1 to 10 and an additional Box 13. Of the former, there were 3 boxes containing booby prizes, 1 containing a star prize (e.g. a small car) and 6 containing other prizes (of which 1 was a \"treasure chest\" of cash). One box also included the option to choose Box 13. The host offered an alternative prize of up to about \u00a350 (or, in the revival, a number of hundreds of pounds) in cash and the contestant had to choose between \"taking the money\" and \"opening the box\".\n\nIn this game, the contestant might answer 3 out of 4 questions correctly before the contestant picks the boxes from 1 to 10 and activating box 13 within the 10 boxes like cinema tickets, baby food,cowboy hats or pork pies which relates to a prize, but also with larger prizes containing such as television sets, video players, cash, karaoke machines, double beds, music vouchers & sofas and booby prizes containing nose hair trimmers, last night's cold food, a box of chocolates, breakfast cereals, rotten tomatoes, cat food and dog food and the star prizes containing kitchen appliances, cars, motorbikes, jet skis, hotels, computers and holidays.\n\nCultural references\n\nA sketch in Monty Python's Flying Circus (called \"Spot the Brain Cell\" in a later audio version) has John Cleese  playing an \"evil\" game show host, hitting contestants over the head with a giant hammer, which is clearly a wildly exaggerated version of Michael Miles (the game he is hosting is a parody of the \"Yes-No Interlude\" from Take Your Pick!). An early version of this sketch appeared in At Last the 1948 Show. For a time after Miles' death the sketch was not shown by the BBC, but it has since been reinstated.\n\nAlso, in the Hungarian Tourist sketch in Monty Python's Flying Circus, a prosecutor (played by Eric Idle) plays the game with Alexander Yalt (played by Michael Palin). The prosecutor manages to gong Yalt \"out\" for answering a question with \"yes\" (although, Yalt was probably unaware of playing the game in the first place).\n\nA sketch in the BBC Radio comedy series The Burkiss Way featured a \"Dinosaur-Cheese Interlude\", in which contestants were required to answer questions without mentioning any species of dinosaur or any variety of cheese (besides Edam, which was \"made\" backwards). Naturally, all the contestants did accidentally mention them.\n\nA fifth season episode of the radio show Hancock's Half Hour (broadcast May 1958) had Tony Hancock appear on the (unnamed) show and win \u00a34,000.\n\nThe British progressive rock band Hatfield and the North named one of their songs \"The Yes No Interlude\". It is included in their second LP, The Rotters' Club.\n\nThe 1970s radio programme I'm Sorry, I'll Read That Again made frequent references to Take Your Pick with phrases such as \"Stake the bunny!\" \"Open the box!\"\n\nTransmissions\n\nAssociated-Rediffusion\n\nOnly 6 out of the 494 episodes from the Associated-Rediffusion era survived from the archives including Episode 2 of Series 1, Episode 39 of Series 10, Episodes 1-2 of Series 12 and Episodes 18 & 44 of Series 13. \n\nThames\n", "context_len": 1157, "questions": ["Which New Zealander presented Take Your Pick on radio and TV"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Ian Robert Maxwell", "Maxwell, Robert", "Ian Robert Maxwell MC", "Maxwell, (Ian) Robert", "(Ian) Robert Maxwell", "J\u00e1n Ludv\u00edk Hoch", "J\u00e1n Ludwig Hoch", "Ian Ludwig Hoch", "Jan Ludwig Hoch", "Robert Maxwell (politician)", "Robert Ian Maxwell", "J\u00e1n Ludvik Hoch", "Robert Maxwell"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

This was during a time where HIV was highly stigmatised and people living with the virus were suffering behind closed doors, some too scared to even tell their loved ones. The artists wanted to create a visual expression of compassion for people living with, and affected by, HIV.\nThe artists were inspired by the yellow ribbons tied on trees to show support for the US military fighting in the Gulf War. Pink and rainbow stripes were rejected because they were too closely associated with the gay community, and they wanted to convey that HIV went beyond the gay community and was relevant to everyone.\nRed was chosen as it is bold and visible \u2013 symbolising passion, a heart and love. The shape was chosen simply because it was easy to make and replicate \u2013 anyone can make one by just cutting out a piece of ribbon, looping it around your finger and pinning it on themselves.\nHow did the red ribbon become so well known?\nIn the early days, the artists made the ribbons themselves and distributed them around the New York art scene and dropped them off at theatres. Initially there was text that went with it, to explain why they were being worn, but eventually this was dropped as its symbolism no longer needed an explanation.\nWithin weeks of the red ribbon idea being born, world-famous actors starting wearing it to high-profile award ceremonies such as the Oscars and talking about why it was important. The media also took notice, and within a short space of time the red ribbon symbol became universally recognised.\nAt the Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert, held at London's Wembley Stadium on Easter Sunday, 1992, more than 100,000 red ribbons were distributed among the audience, with performers such as George Michael wearing one.

For example, a 15-watt LED light bulb draws 15 watts of electricity at any moment when turned on.\nWatt-hours are a measurement of energy, describing the total amount of electricity used over time. Watt-hours are a combination of how fast the electricity is used (watts) and the length of time it is used (hours). For example, a 15-watt light bulb, which draws 15 watts at any one moment, uses 15 watt-hours of electricity in the course of one hour.\nKilowatts and kilowatt-hours are useful for measuring amounts of electricity used by large appliances and by households. Kilowatt-hours are what show up on your electricity bill, describing how much electricity you have used. One kilowatt (kW) equals 1,000 watts, and one kilowatt-hour (kWh) is one hour of using electricity at a rate of 1,000 watts. New, energy-efficient refrigerators use about 300-400 kilowatt-hours per year. The typical American home uses about 7,200 kilowatt-hours of electricity each year [1].\nMegawatts are used to measure the output of a power plant or the amount of electricity required by an entire city. One megawatt (MW) = 1,000 kilowatts = 1,000,000 watts. For example, a typical coal plant is about 600 MW in size.\nGigawatts measure the capacity of large power plants or of many plants.

The force is armed with cutting-edge weaponry, well-funded and answers only to one man. How can a group -- trained as professional assassins and approaching the status of mercenaries -- be reeled in if the U.S. government won't even confirm that the group exists? Does such a force make the United States safer or more vulnerable? It's questions like these that swirl around the United States' most elite tactical combat group, the Delta Force.\nDelta Force is often referred to as Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta. It's also known as the Combat Applications Group (CAG). While it often draws its ranks from the Army Special Forces (the Army Green Berets ) and shares Fort Bragg, N.C. , headquarters with them, it isn't an Army Special Forces detachment. Delta Force is a unit unto itself, composed of members from all branches of the military.\nUp Next\nThe U.S. Armed Forces Quiz\nThey're not called soldiers, but operators and are said to shun the traditional philosophies of military life. They wear civilian clothes. They work for whomever needs them -- for the Army, the FBI and the CIA . Mark Bowden, author of the book \"Blackhawk Down\" -- for which he interviewed several Delta Force members -- famously said of the operators, \"They are professional soldiers who hate the Army\" [source: Military.com ].\nIt must be said that neither the United States government nor the military officially acknowledges the existence of Delta Force. To this end, almost all of the information contained in this article is unsupported by any official reports from the United States. It's only in recent years that vague references by the government to the group's existence have been allowed to go uncensored. These references have turned up in transcripts from Congressional hearings and biographies of high-ranking military leaders.\nBut it's nearly impossible to keep a force so deadly and made up of the stuff of legends entirely under wraps. Since its inception in 1977, stories of the Delta Force's exploits and missions have leaked out, little by little, eventually forming a brief sketch of the unit. In 1993, Delta Force came under the microscope when its operators were among those who fought and died in a failed operation to remove a Somali warlord. And in Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada in 1983, reports of two missions by Delta Force -- one failed and one successful -- have become common knowledge [source: SOC ].\nBut the group has been criticized for undertaking missions that are on the fringe of regular laws governing the military. This causes some to worry that Delta Force has more power and less accountability than any military organization in a free democracy should. Delta Force is funded out of secret government accounts, away from the public eye, and is believed to answer only to the president.\nBut others claim that its purpose -- maintaining the United States' role as a leading power and as the world's police force -- necessitates the lack of restrictions and accountability surrounding its activities.\nIn the next section, we'll look at how the Delta Force is structured.\n1\n", "context_len": 640, "questions": ["Active since 1977, Which unit is the only official US Army Counter-Terrorism force?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Trent", "Trent (disambiguation)", "TRENT"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nTiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn\nTiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn (literally, \"Sch\u00f6nbrunn Zoo\"), or \"Vienna Zoo\", is a zoo located on the grounds of the famous Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace in Vienna, Austria. Founded as an imperial menagerie in 1752, it is the oldest zoo in the world.\nToday, Tiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn is considered and regards itself as a scientifically administered zoo which sees its main purpose as a centre for species conservation and general nature conservation as well as in the fulfillment of the education mandate given to it by the legislation. The still preserved buildings of the baroque era, which have been complemented in the last years by elements of modern zoo architecture, still convey a good impression of the 18th century menagerie-buildings after the Versailles model.\n\nDescription\n\nTiergarten Sch\u00f6nbrunn is one of the few zoos worldwide to house giant pandas.  The zoo's pandas are named Yang Yang (F), Long Hui (M), Fu Long (M), and Fu Hu (M).   Fu Long's birth on 23 August 2007 was the first natural insemination panda birth in Europe.   Fu Hu was born exactly 3 years later, and he was also conceived by natural mating.  One more panda cub, Fu Bao (\u798f\u8c79), was born nearly three years later on 14 August 2013 via natural mating. \n\nOther zoo attractions include a rainforest house, in which the spectator is led through a simulation of the Amazon rainforest, an aquarium, which enables  spectators to walk through underneath a simulation of the Amazon in flood, and, more recently, an exhibit of animals in unnatural habitats.  The new polarium for animals of the Arctic region was opened in early 2004.\n\nOn 14 July 1906, the zoo saw the birth of the first elephant in captivity. \n\nFrom its privatization in 1992, it has been led by Helmut Pechlaner, also president of WWF Austria, who managed to modernize most parts of the zoo and sustain its financial situation. Nowadays, as of 2014, the zoo is managed by Dagmar Schratter.\n\nPrivate and corporate sponsorship for the various animals is one of the methods employed by the zoo today, along with bookable night excursions and special children's programs. Zoological research takes place at the zoo.\n\nHistory\n\nThe zoo was constructed in 1752 next to Schloss Sch\u00f6nbrunn by Adrian van Stekhoven at the order of the then Holy Roman Emperor, Francis I, husband of Maria Theresia, to serve as an imperial menagerie. It was centered around a pavilion meant for imperial breakfasts. Therefore, thirteen animal enclosures in the form of cut cake pieces were established around this central pavilion.\n\nThe central pavilions and the menagerie building were built by Jean Nicolas Jadot de Ville-Issey. A small zoo had already existed on the premises since 1540, but the complex was opened to the public only in 1779. Initially, there were no entrance fees.\n\nHoly Roman Emperor Joseph II organized expeditions to Africa and the Americas to procure specimens for the zoo. The arrival of the first giraffe in 1828 influenced Viennese fashion and city life. Clothes', accessories', and other items' designs were influenced, and Adolf B\u00e4uerle performed his play titled Giraffes in Vienna ().\n\nAt the onset of World War I, the zoo was home to 712 species and 3,500 specimens. Due to diminishing food supplies during the war, the number of specimens rapidly sank to 900. After the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire after the war, the zoo became the responsibility of the Austrian Republic.\n\nBombing raids on February 19 and February 21, 1945, during World War II, had an even greater impact on the zoo. Many buildings were destroyed and specimens killed, reducing the stock of specimens to 400. The new zoo director, Dr. Julius Brachetka, eventually managed to restore the zoo.\n\nThe zoo experienced a financial crisis in the 1980s, but closure of the zoo was prevented by privatization in 1992. Dr. Helmut Pechlaner was assigned as manager of the zoo. After his retirement on 1 January 2007, his deputy, Dr. Dagmar Schratter, took over his post.\n\nPechlaner was able to renovate and extend many of the enclosures thanks to a number of sponsors and significantly increased entrance fees. During his time as manager, the zoo was extended by a number of new buildings, including the rainforest house, the desert house, and the \"Tyrolean farmhouse\". A number of rare and exotic specimens, such as giant pandas and koalas, were attracted to the zoo and contributed to its upswing in popularity.\n\nIn the media\n\nA number of tragic accidents have plagued the zoo. In 2002, a jaguar attacked a caretaker during feeding, killing her in front of zoo visitors. The director tried to help and sustained heavy arm injuries. In February 2005, a young elephant, Abu, lethally crushed his caretaker. In the following press storm, director Pechlaner offered to resign over the issue. \n\nThe zoo is a filming location for the ORF series, Tom Turbo, which is based on a series of children's books by Thomas Brezina. Tom Turbo has its garage at the zoo since 2006, and is, together with its creator, sponsor of a tiger at the zoo. Former zoo director Pechlaner makes cameo appearances in a number of episodes.\n\nThe 250 Years Vienna Zoo Silver Coin\n\nThe zoo is so popular and famous that on its 250th anniversary, it was the topic of one of the most famous silver collectors' coins: the 5 euro 250 Years of Vienna Zoo commemorative coin minted on 8 May 2002.\n\nThe reverse shows the Emperor's Pavilion surrounded by a variety of animals from the zoo. The dates 1752-2002 refer to the anniversary and, of course, date the coin itself.\n\nLiterature \n\n* Ash, Mitchell and Dittrich, Lothar (ed.), Menagerie des Kaisers \u2013 Zoo der Wiener, Pichler Verlag, Vienna, 2002.

He then studied at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, where Friedrich Walchner's lectures first stimulated his interest in chemistry. Next he attended the school of commerce in Leipzig, where he studied chemistry under Otto Linn\u00e9 Erdmann, who further developed his interest into a passion for questions of speculative chemistry.\n\nReturning home in 1834, he entered his father\u2019s white lead factory, but soon found that business was not to his liking, and after a sharp disagreement with his father in his 20th year he enlisted in a cavalry regiment. In a few months military life became equally distasteful, and he purchased his discharge with the assistance of the German chemist Justus von Liebig. After a short period of living in Dresden, he went to the University of Giessen in central Germany in 1836 to study and work in Liebig's laboratory. His stay at Giessen lasted 18 months, and in 1837 he re-entered the factory. Again, however, he quarrelled with his father, and in 1838 he went to Paris with introductions from Liebig.\n\nIn Paris, he attended Jean Baptiste Dumas\u2019 lectures and worked with Auguste Cahours (1813\u20131891) on essential oils, especially cumin, in Michel Eug\u00e8ne Chevreul\u2019s laboratory at the Jardin des Plantes, meanwhile earning a precarious living by teaching and making translations of some of Liebig\u2019s writings. In 1841, through the influence of Dumas, he was charged with the duties of chemistry professor at the Montpellier faculty of sciences, becoming titular professor in 1844.\n\nIn 1842 he annoyed his friends in Paris by the matter and manner of a paper on the classification of organic compounds. Later, he published Pr\u00e9cis de chimie organique (1844\u20131845). In 1845 he and his opinions were the subject of an attack by Liebig, unjustifiable in its personalities but not altogether surprising in view of his wayward disregard of his patron\u2019s advice. The two were reconciled in 1850, but his faculty for disagreeing with his friends did not make it easier for him to get another appointment after resigning the chair at Montpellier in 1851, especially as he was unwilling to go into the provinces.\n\nHe obtained leave of absence from Montpellier in 1848 so that he could pursue without interruption his special investigations, and from that year until 1855 he resided in Paris. During that period he established an \u00c9cole de chimie pratique (\"School for practical chemistry\") for which he had great hopes. However, these hopes were disappointed, and in 1855, after refusing the offer of a chair of chemistry at the new Z\u00fcrich Polytechnic in 1854, he accepted the professorships of chemistry at the Faculty of Sciences and the \u00c9cole Polytechnique at Strassburg, where he died the following year, having just completed checking the proofs for Trait\u00e9 de chimie organique (4 vols., Paris, 1853\u201356), his magnum opus. This latter work embodies all his ideas and his discoveries.\n\nWork\n\nGerhardt is known for his work on reforming the notation for chemical formulas (1843\u20131846). He also worked on acid anhydrides, and synthesized acetylsalicylic acid, albeit in an unstable and impure form.\n\nGerhardt is usually linked with his contemporary, Auguste Laurent, with whom he shared a strong and influential interest in chemical combination.\n\nDeath\n\nHe died on August 19, 1856, two days short of his birthday, after being poisoned by his own chemicals during laboratory work. He was 39 years old.\n\nNotes\n", "context_len": 680, "questions": ["\"in 1853 while working on the synthesis and properties of various acid anhydrides, French chemist Charles Frederic Gerhardt made acetylsalicylic acid by mixing acetyl chloride with a sodium salt of salicylic acid (sodium salicylate).

{"context": "\nHashemites\nThe House of Hashim, better known as the Hashemites Hashmi (, al-H\u0101shim\u012by\u016bn; also \"Hashimites\" or \"Hashimids\"), are the royal family of the Hejaz (1916\u20131925), Iraq (1921\u20131958), and Jordan (1921\u2013present). The family belongs to the Dhawu Awn, one of the branches of the Hasanid Sharifs of Mecca \u2013 also referred to as Hashemites \u2013 who ruled Mecca continuously from the 10th century until its conquest by the House of Saud in 1924. Their eponymous ancestor is Hashim ibn Abd Manaf, great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad. The current dynasty was founded by Sharif Hussein ibn Ali, who was appointed as Sharif and Emir of Mecca by Sultan Abdul Hamid II in 1908, then in 1916 was proclaimed King of the Arab Lands (but only recognized as King of the Hejaz) after initiating the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. His sons Abdullah and Faisal assumed the thrones of Jordan and Iraq in 1921.\n\nHistory \n\nThe Hashemites  claim to trace their ancestry from Hashim ibn 'Abd Manaf (died c. 497 AD), the great-grandfather of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, although the definition today mainly refers to the descendants of Muhammad's daughter Fatimah.  The early history of the Hashemites saw them in a continuous struggle against the Umayyads for control over who would be the caliph or successor to Muhammad. The Umayyads were of the same tribe as the Hashemites, but a different clan. After the overthrow of the Umayyads, the Abbasids would present themselves as representatives of the Hashemites, as they claimed descent from Abbas ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib, an uncle of Muhammad. Muhammad's father had died before he was born, and his mother died while he was a child, so Muhammad was raised by his uncle Abu Talib ibn \u2018Abd al-Muttalib, chief of the Hashemites. \n\nFrom the 10th century onwards, the sharif (religious leader) of Mecca and its Emir was, by traditional agreement, a Hashemite. Before World War I, Hussein bin Ali of the Hashemite Dhawu-'Awn clan ruled the Hejaz on behalf of the Ottoman sultan. For some time it had been the practice of the Sublime Porte to appoint the Emir of Mecca from among a select group of candidates. In 1908, Hussein bin Ali was appointed to the Emirate of Mecca. He found himself increasingly at odds with the Young Turks in control at Istanbul, while he strove to secure his family's position as hereditary Emirs.\n\nDuring and after World War I \n\nSharif Hussein bin Ali rebelled against the rule of the Ottomans during the Arab Revolt of 1916.  Between 1917 and 1924, after the collapse of Ottoman power, Hussein bin Ali ruled an independent Hejaz, of which he proclaimed himself king, with the tacit support of the British Foreign Office. His supporters are sometimes referred to as \"Sharifians\" or the \"Sharifian party\". Hussein bin Ali's chief rival in the Arabian Peninsula, the king of the Najd (highlands), Ibn Saud, annexed the Hejaz in 1925 and established his own son, Faysal bin Abdulaziz Al Saud, as governor. The region was later incorporated into Saudi Arabia.\n\nHussein bin Ali had five sons:\n\n* Ali, who briefly succeeded to the throne of Hejaz before its loss to the Saud family in 1925.\n* Abdullah, became the amir of Transjordan in 1921 and king of Jordan in 1946, and whose descendants continue to rule the kingdom known ever since as the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\n* Faisal, briefly proclaimed King of the Arab Kingdom of Syria in 1920, became King of Iraq in 1921.\n* Prince Zeid bin Hussein, who moved to Jordan when his brother's grandson, King Faisal II of Iraq, was overthrown and murdered in a coup in 1958.\n* Hassan, died at a young age.\n\nFamily tree\n", "context_len": 717, "questions": ["The Hashemite ruler Faisal 2nd was the last king of which country?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Isosceles triangle", "Isoceles", "Isoceles triangle", "Isosceles triange", "Isosceles"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

Even though it first appeared in Italian cooking books (constituting one of the simplest sauces of the Italian cuisine), it is now considered one of the mother sauces of French cuisine.  It is used as the base for other sauces (such as Mornay sauce, which is B\u00e9chamel with cheese). \n\nOrigin\n\nB\u00e9chamel was a financier who held the honorary post of chief steward to King Louis XIV. The sauce first appeared in some Italian cooking books of the Rennaissance, but was introduced under its familiar name in Le Cuisinier Fran\u00e7ois, published in 1651 by  Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne (1615\u20131678), chef de cuisine to Nicolas Chalon du Bl\u00e9, marquis d'Uxelles. The foundation of French cuisine, the Cuisinier Fran\u00e7ois ran through some thirty editions in seventy-five years.\n\nThe sauce originally was a veal velout\u00e9 with a large amount of cream added. \n\nSaulnier's R\u00e9pertoire presents one recipe as: \"White roux moistened with milk, salt, onion stuck with clove, cook for 20 minutes.\" \n\nPreparation\n\nB\u00e9chamel is traditionally made by melting a quantity of butter, and adding an equal part of flour to make a roux, which is cooked under gentle heat while stirring with a whisk. As it is a white sauce, care must be taken not to brown the roux. Then heated milk is gradually whisked in, and the sauce is cooked until thickened and smooth. The proportion of roux and milk determines the thickness of the sauce, typically one to three tablespoons each of flour and butter per cup of milk. \n\nOne tablespoon each of butter and flour per cup of milk makes a thin, easily pourable sauce.  Two tablespoons of each makes a medium thick sauce. Three tablespoons of each makes an extra thick sauce, such as used to fill croquettes or as a souffl\u00e9 base. Salt and white pepper are added and it is customary in Italy to add a pinch of nutmeg.  Optionally a whole or cut onion, studded with one or more whole cloves, and a bay leaf may be simmered with the milk and then strained before adding to the roux.\n\nUses\n\nSauces\n\nB\u00e9chamel sauce is the base for a number of other classic sauces with additional ingredients added including:\n*Mornay sauce (cheese)\n*Nantua sauce (crayfish, butter and cream)\n*Cr\u00e8me sauce (heavy cream)\n*Mustard sauce (prepared mustard seed)\n*Soubise sauce (finely diced onions that have been sweated in butter)\n*Cheddar cheese sauce (Cheddar cheese, dry mustard, Worcestershire sauce)\n\nThe term \"white sauce\" or sauce blanche may also be applied to a simple sauce consisting only of milk and melted butter, without flour or spices. \n\nDishes\n\nDishes made with b\u00e9chamel sauce include:\n*Cauliflower cheese\n*Croque Monsieur (some variations)\n*Croquette\n*Fisherman's Pie\n*Lasagne\n*Parmo, a type of escalop originating in Middlesbrough, that is popular in North East England.\n*Moussaka and pastitsio, layered dishes found in Greece and throughout the Balkans and Middle East\n*Veal Orlov\n", "context_len": 591, "questions": ["What is the sauce made from adding cheese to a Bechamel sauce?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Tin-tin", "Tin-Tin", "Tin tin", "TinTin", "TINTIN", "Tintin (disambiguation)", "Tin Tin", "Tintin (TV series)", "Tintin"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nWorld's Greatest Dad\nWorld's Greatest Dad is a 2009 American satirical black comedy film written and directed by Bobcat Goldthwait. It stars Robin Williams, Daryl Sabara, and Alexie Gilmore. The film was released on July 24, 2009 on video on demand providers before its limited theatrical release on August 21, 2009.\n\nPlot\n\nLance Clayton (Williams) is a single father and high school English teacher. He dreams of becoming a famous writer, but his previous novels have all been rejected by publishers. His 15-year-old son, Kyle (Sabara), is a pornography-obsessed underachiever who despises everyone, especially his father.  Kyle is a student at the school where Lance teaches an unpopular poetry class. His only friend is Andrew, a fellow student who spends his evenings at the Claytons' house trying to avoid his alcoholic mother. Kyle's consistently poor academic performance and vile behavior gain the attention of the school principal (Geoff Pierson), who advises Lance that Kyle should transfer to a special-needs school. Lance is in a non-committal relationship with a younger teacher named Claire (Gilmore), who is spending time with a fellow teacher named Mike (Henry Simmons), whose writing class is more successful than Lance's. On nights when Claire cancels their dates and he is alone, Lance bonds with his elderly neighbor Bonnie (Mitzi McCall).\n\nOne night, after Kyle and Lance spend an evening with Claire, Lance discovers that Kyle has died in an autoerotic asphyxiation accident in his bedroom. To avoid embarrassing his son, he stages Kyle\u2019s death as a suicide. He writes a suicide note on Kyle\u2019s computer and hangs his son\u2019s body in the closet. A classmate later obtains the suicide note from police records and publishes it in the school newspaper. The note strikes a chord with the students and faculty, and suddenly many students claim to have been friends with Kyle and are touched by how deep and intelligent he shows himself to be in his writings.\n\nEnjoying the attention his writing is finally receiving, Lance decides to write and publish a phony journal that was supposedly written by his son before his death. Kyle becomes something of a post-mortem cult phenomenon at the school, and soon Lance begins to receive the adoration that he has always desired. Andrew finds Kyle\u2019s suicide note and journals as highly uncharacteristic based on Kyle's personality when he was alive, but Lance brushes him off when Andrew confronts him. The journal soon attracts the attention of book publishers and Lance lands a television appearance on a nationally broadcast talk show. The school principal then decides to rename the school library in Kyle\u2019s honor. \n\nAt the library dedication, Lance finds that he can no longer live with his lie and confesses before the school. Lance is denounced by the students and faculty, including Claire. Lance nevertheless feels reborn, and dives naked into the school's swimming pool. Andrew tells Lance he knew the truth all along, and that he enjoyed Lance's writing. The two of them happily watch a zombie movie with Bonnie.\n\nCast\n\n* Robin Williams as Lance Clayton\n* Alexie Gilmore as Claire Reed\n* Daryl Sabara as Kyle Clayton\n* Evan Martin as Andrew\n* Geoff Pierson as Principal Wyatt Anderson\n* Henry Simmons as Mike Lane\n* Mitzi McCall as Bonnie\n* Jermaine Williams as Jason\n* Lorraine Nicholson as Heather\n* Morgan Murphy as Morgan\n* Toby Huss as Bert Green\n* Tom Kenny as Jerry Klein (talk show producer)\n* Jill Talley as Make-Up Woman\n* Bruce Hornsby as himself\n* Krist Novoselic as Newspaper Vendor (cameo)\n* Bobcat Goldthwait as the limo driver (uncredited)\n\nProduction\n\nThe film was shot in Seattle, Washington, largely at the former F.A. McDonald School in Wallingford.  Seattle resident and former Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic has a wordless cameo while consoling Williams' character at a newspaper stand (Goldthwait had previously opened for Nirvana). Bruce Hornsby appears as himself at the library dedication.\n\nHome video\n\nThe DVD was released on December 8, 2009 and featured an audio commentary track with the director, deleted scenes, outtakes, and a making of featurette.\n\nReception\n\nWorld's Greatest Dad received critical acclaim, holding an 89% \"Certified Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 116 reviews, with an average rating of 6.9/10, with the critical consensus: \"World's Greatest Dad is a risky, deadpan, dark comedy that effectively explores the nature of posthumous cults of celebrity.\"  The film also holds a score of 69 out of 100 on Metacritic, based on 24 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\" \n\nThe film was a hit at the Sundance Film Festival, the website hailing it as a \"lusciously perverse, and refreshingly original comedy that tackles love, loss, and our curious quest for infamy.\" It also commented on Robin Williams' performance as outstanding. Sandra L. Frey observed the film's portrayal of teen angst, and said that the film also reminds the audience that adults can offer strong angst of their own.  Devin Faraci called the film \"brilliant\" and \"genius.\" Paul Fischer named it as one of the best films of the year.  Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz both gave the film favorable reviews on At The Movies. Mankiewicz saluted Daryl Sabara's performance as exceptionally well done, commented on the film's \"remarkably funny script,\" and overall considered it a \"little gem.\" Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave World's Greatest Dad 3 out of 4 stars, but noticed that the material could have been even darker in its satire, and he questioned whether it was the director's intention.\n", "context_len": 1065, "questions": ["Which actor said, in the film \u2018World\u2019s Greatest Dad\u2019, \u2018I used to think the worst thing in life was to end up all alone.

{"context": "\nSwansea Bay\nSwansea Bay () is a bay on the Bristol Channel on the southern coast of Wales. Places on the bay include Swansea and Port Talbot. The River Neath, River Tawe, River Afan, River Kenfig and Clyne River flow into the bay.\n\nSwansea Bay (and upper reaches of the Bristol Channel) experience a large tidal range (Springs max 10m).  The shipping ports in Swansea Bay are Swansea Docks, Port Talbot Docks and Briton Ferry wharfs.\n\nHistory \n\nOyster fishing was once an important industry in Swansea Bay, employing 600 people at its height in the 1860s. However, overfishing, disease and pollution had all but wiped out the oyster population by 1920. In 2005 plans were announced to reintroduce the Oyster farming industry.  \n\nBeaches\n\nThe bay is lined with sandy beaches. Each stretch of beach within the bay has its own individual name:\n*Aberavon Beach\n*Baglan Bay\n*Jersey Marine Beach\n*Swansea Beach\n*Mumbles Beach\n\nPollution\n\nFor the last two decades of the 20th century, the bay was blighted by pollution, partly from the surrounding heavy industry and partly from sewerage outlets being sited at inappropriate locations including the main one that was located just seaward of Mumbles Lighthouse. A pumping station inside the cliff adjacent to Knab Rock brought all of Swansea city's effluent in a raw form to this point. Adding to the problem was the natural current flow of the waters in the Bay which often did not move the polluted waters further out to sea. Ironically, the outgoing tide did not carry the raw sewage down the adjacent Bristol Channel, but instead cause it to be sucked in around the circumference of the Bay and only then out down the Channel. If not fully discharged on that tide, the incoming tide would then push the same effluent up the Channel, and once again circulate around the Bay. Efforts were made by the local authority to reduce the pollution in the Bay but care had to be taken to ensure the pollution did not move to the popular beach resorts in south Gower instead.\n\nThis original sewer outlet was finally made inactive in around 1996 following the construction of a brand new pipeline which ran all the way back around the Bay following the line of the old Mumbles Railway as far as Beach Street, along the sea-side of the Maritime Quarter and through Swansea Docks to a new \u00a390 million sewage treatment plant at Crymlyn Burrows near Port Tennant from which a new outlet was made, extending further out to sea. As a consequence of the huge improvement these works have made, it is hoped that Swansea Bay will achieve Blue Flag Beach status.  Aberavon beach was awarded Blue Flag status in December 2007. \n\nPower generation\n\nFossil\n\nThere is one existing GE built gas-fired power station located just inland at Baglan Bay.  A second gas fired power station, the \"Abernedd Power Station\" has been approved for construction. \n\nBiomass plans\n\nA new biomass power station has been approved for construction near the coast at Port Talbot. \n\nTidal plans\n\nSwansea Bay (along with the rest of the Bristol Channel) has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world. This offers a potential for electricity generation using tidal lagoons.  A proposal has been put forward by Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay Ltd. for a tidal lagoon to be constructed.   The tidal lagoon would be sited just south of the Queen's Dock between River Tawe and River Neath estuaries.  This project is controversial, partly due to the amount of subsidy required to make the project viable and also because of the potential damage to an AONB and MCZ in Cornwall where Tidal Lagoon Swansea Bay seek to re-open a disused quarry at Dean Point from which to source the rock for the lagoon.    \n\nWind plans\n\nIn addition to tidal power, construction of an offshore windfarm in the Bay has been approved,  but construction has now been deferred owing to the costs involved. The windfarm was to have been sited at Scarweather Sands, about 3 mi off the coast and visible from Porthcawl.\n", "context_len": 746, "questions": ["Which geographical feature separates Swansea Bay from Carmarthen Bay?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Chili Pepper", "Red Chili", "Hot peppers", "Red chile", "Red chili", "Chili (capsicum)", "Chili Peppers", "Chili pepper", "Chilli pepper", "Chillies", "Chilli (pepper)", "Chile peppers", "\ud83c\udf36", "Chili peppers", "Hot pepper", "Chilli", "Green chilies", "Dahon ng sili", "Red chillies", "Chilli peppers", "Chile pepper", "Chilly pepper", "Green chile", "Green chillies", "Red Chillies", "Gochoo", "Chile (capsicum)", "Green chili"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nSandy Powell (comedian)\nSandy Powell MBE (30 January 1900 \u2013 26 June 1982) was an English comedian best known for his radio work of the 1930s and for his catchphrase Can You Hear Me, Mother?. He first said this in a theatre in Coventry. Fifty years later, deciding he needed a rest from the business (he planned a cruise around the world with his wife), he again said it in a Coventry theatre, for the last time.\n\nEarly life \n\nBorn Albert Arthur Powell in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, England in 1900, he attended White's school in Masbrough where he helped his mother (stage name of Lily le Maine) to put on a marionette show. At age nine, she put him in a velvet suit with a lace collar and he went on stage and sang. After he left school he became a music hall entertainer, often wearing a kilt in the guise of a Scottish comedian. During this part of his career he was associated with the singer Gracie Fields, and released several records where he collaborated with her.\n\nStage and recording \n\nHe made a total of eighty five 78rpm records between 1929 and 1942,  mostly double-sided sketches with him in various occupations. He sold seven and a half million records, earning a penny a side, so over \u00a360,000. The first, The Lost Policeman on the cheap Broadcast label, sold almost half a million copies (he had turned down a flat fee of \u00a360 for this), and his subsequent recordings for Broadcast and Rex were extremely popular. He said in a 1982 interview  that he used his stage work to advertise the records, rather than the other way about, though it was later said of him that his records introduced him so wherever he went to put on a show, they already knew him..\n\nSandy had a stooge in his act during the 1930s, the boy soprano, Jimmy Fletcher, father of the actor Gerard Fletcher, of Emmerdale, Coronation Street and other TV. From 1930 he took his own revue, Sandy Powell's Road Show, on tour \u2013 it ran for ten years and was extremely popular despite having only a handful of performers and two backdrops.\n\nRadio and film \n\nIn the 1930s he began to work on the radio, always introducing his show with catchphrase Can You Hear Me, Mother? Powell said that the catchphrase originated on an occasion when he had dropped his script and was killing time at the microphone while rearranging the pages. It is also attributed to his mother's coercion and her hardness of hearing, during his early career. At his next booking, the theatre manager asked him to say it again as everyone was saying it now. He also appeared in a number of films during the 1930s, usually as himself. In 1939 he was voted the fifth most popular British star at the local box office. \n\nA popular figure, he worked continually on radio, television and pantomime through the 1940s and 1950s. Aged 21 at the time, Pat Phoenix was brought in to play Sandy's wife and played four parts in the film. After that he want onto a variety tour and she came with him as his wife, earning \u00a312 a week. He performed with his Starlight company in the Eastbourne Pier theatre for over fifteen seasons in the 1950s and 1960s, earning himself the sobriquet 'Mr Eastbourne', and he was still performing occasionally up to his death in 1982. Part of his act was a comedy ventriloquism act, where the dummy would fall apart. After being on stage for a few weeks with a series of awful ventriloquists, he bought a dummy himself and did his own act as a ventriloquist. When Pat Phoenix as his wife who \"fed him lines\" asked if the dummy could sing something, he replied \"If I know it, he can sing it!\"\n\nHonour \n\nHe was still well-known enough to have a pub in his home town of Rotherham [http://www.rotherhampubs.f9.co.uk/Comedian.html dedicated to him] in 1970 and was awarded the MBE in 1975. \n\nDeath\n\nFor a day or two, he thought he had bad indigestion but it was worse than he realised and he died of a heart attack on 26 June 1982.\n\nSelected filmography\n\n*The Third String (1932)\n* Soft Lights and Sweet Music (1936)\n*It's a Grand Old World (1937)\n*I've Got a Horse (1938)\n*Home from Home (1939)\n*Cup-tie Honeymoon (1948)\n", "context_len": 847, "questions": ["Whose catchphrase was 'Can you hear me Mother'?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Top Gear UK", "Top Gear (disambiguation)", "TopGear", "Top gear", "Top Gear", "Top Gear (Disambiguation)", "Top Gear (TV series)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nGil Eanes\nGil Eanes (or Eannes, in the old Portuguese spelling;) was a 15th-century Portuguese navigator and explorer.\n\nEanes was born in Lagos  in 1395. Little is known about his personal life prior to his role in the Portuguese Age of Discovery, and was considered a household servant and shield-bearer of the Infante Henry the Navigator. He was a native of Lagos on which he based his sea voyages, in the southern Algarve.  \n\nHe joined the service of Prince Henry's expeditions in 1433, when the Infante entrusted him with a vessel and crew, in order to attempt to round Cape Bojador, an impassable cape, with the then level of knowledge and equipment.  Sailing from Lagos, Portugal, Eanes made an unknown number of voyages along the west coast of Africa, before being driven west towards the Canary Islands.  In the islands he captured some inoffensive natives and returned with them as captives to Sagres, excusing his failure by recounting the dangers of the trip. His return was greeted with reserve and coldness in the court of Prince Henry, who had expected the navigator to succeed in rounding the Cape. Eanes hoped to return to favour in the following year, if the Prince would favour him with a second expedition. In 1434, his barquentine-caravel and crew was able to sail beyond Cape Bojador and return to Sagres, reporting the conditions of the water, land and ease of navigation beyond the Cape, and bringing with him some wild roses to prove that they had succeeded in their expedition.  The discovery of a passable route around Cape Bojador marked the beginning of the Portuguese exploration of Africa. \n\nEanes made another voyage, with Afonso Gon\u00e7alves Baldaia, in 1435. They sailed about 30 leagues (144\u00a0km), or even 50 leagues (240\u00a0km) south of Cape Bojador and reached the African coast. Although they did not discover any inhabitants immediately, they did find traces of a human presence, during a voyage that was considered favourable.

{"context": "\nPurlin\nIn architecture, structural engineering or building, a purlin (or historically purline, purloyne, purling, perling) is any longitudinal, horizontal, structural member in a roof except a type of framing with what is called a crown plate. In traditional timber framing there are three basic types of purlin: purlin plate, principal purlin and common purlin.\n\nPurlin plates in wooden construction\n\nA purlin plate in wooden construction is also called an \"arcade plate\" in European English,  \"under purlin\", and \"principal purlin\". The term plate means a major, horizontal, supporting timber. Purlin plates are beams which support the mid-span of rafters and are supported by posts. By supporting the rafters they allow longer spans than the rafters alone could span thus allowing a wider building. Purlin plates are very commonly found in large, old barns in North America. A crown plate has similarities to a purlin plate but supports collar beams in the middle of a timber framed building.\n\nPrincipal purlins in wood construction\n\nPrincipal purlins in wood construction, also called \"major purlin\", \"side purlin\". Principal purlins are supported by principal rafters and support common rafters in what is known as a \"double roof\" (a roof framed with a layer of principal rafters and a layer of common rafters). Principal purlins are further classified by how they connect to the principal rafters:  \"Through purlins\" pass over the top; \"butt purlins\" tenon into the sides of the principal rafters; \"clasped purlins,\" of which only one historic U.S. example is known,) are captured by a collar beam. Through purlins are further categorized as trenched, back, or clasped; butt purlins are classified as threaded, tenoned, and/or staggered. \n\nCommon purlins in wood construction\n\nCommon purlins in wood construction, also called a \"major-rafter minor-purlin system\".  Common purlins are typically \"trenched through\" the top sides (backs) of principal rafters and carry vertical roof sheathing (The key to identifying this type of roof system). Common purlin roofs in North America are found in areas settled by Englishmen and may have been a new invention in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. No examples of framed buildings with common purlin roofs have been reported in England, however some stone barns in England have vertically boarded, common purlin roofs. Historically, these roofs are found in New England, the highest concentration in Maine, and isolated parts of New York and along the St. Lawrence River in Canada. One of the oldest extant (surviving) examples is in the Coffin House in Newbury, Massachusetts from 1678. The purpose of a common purlin roof may be they allow a board roof, that is a roof of nothing but vertically laid boards with seams covered with battens or another layer of boards. \n\nSteel construction\n\nIn steel construction, the term purlin typically refers to roof framing members that span parallel to the building eave, and support the roof decking or sheeting.  The purlins are in turn supported by rafters or walls. Purlins are most commonly used in Metal Building Systems, where Z-shapes are utilized in a manner that allows flexural continuity between spans.\n\nIt is the practice in the steel industry that structural shapes are assigned representative designations for convenient shorthand description on drawings and documentation: Channel sections, with or without flange stiffeners, are usually referenced as C shapes; Channel sections without flange stiffeners are also referenced as U shapes; Point symmetric sections that are shaped similar to the letter Z are referenced as Z shapes. Section designations can be regional and even specific to a manufacturer. In steel building construction, secondary members such as purlins (roof) and girts (wall) are frequently cold-formed steel C, Z or U sections, (or mill rolled) C sections.\n\nCold formed members can be efficient on a weight basis relative to mill rolled sections for secondary member applications. Additionally, Z sections can be nested for transportation bundling and, on the building, lapped at the supports to develop a structurally efficient continuous beam across multiple supports.\n\nEtymology\n\nInformation on the origin of the term \"purlin\" is scant. The Oxford Dictionary suggests a French origin, with the earliest quote using a variation of purlin in 1447.\n\nGallery\n\nNote: The sketches in this section reference terminology commonly used in the UK and Australia.  \n\nFile:Rf-trad-section.gif| A section though lightweight timber frame construction showing the position of under purlins.\nImage:Metal-purlins.jpg|Roll formed metal roof purlins.

{"context": "\nLiverpool Tart\nThe earliest known mention of a Liverpool Tart is 1897, when it was hand-written into a family cookbook, which was recently included in the village website for Evershot, in Dorset.\n\nBasically a pasty tart, the distinctive taste comes from the mixture of moist sugar (sic) and a boiled lemon, minced. In 2006 this recipe was taken up by Gerry Jones of Liverpool and developed with a view to the tart becoming as widely known and appreciated as the Bakewell and Manchester tarts. In 2008 it was being produced as a regular line by two bakeries in Merseyside, Satterthwaites in Crosby and Dafna's Cheesecake Factory in south Liverpool.  The original recipe called for \"\u00bdlb moist sugar, 2oz butter, 1 egg, 1 lemon, pastry\".\n\nThe process read;\n\" Put the butter and sugar into a moderate oven to melt. When melted, let it cool. Boil your lemon whole very slowly (or it will break) until quite soft. Mince it whole as it is, saving the juice as much as possible and taking out the pips. Mince very fine.\n\nBeat the egg well. Mix all well together. Line a flat open tart dish with good paste, and pour in the mixture to one uniform thickness (about \u00bd an inch), cross bar over and bake. Serve hot or cold.\"\n\nCurrent thinking is that \"moist\" sugar meant dark muscovado, while the lemon may be shredded (after removal of the pips) instead of \"boiling and mincing\". Once the basic tart is baked and setting, thought is then given to a decorative finish. The original \"cross bar over\" is generally agreed to mean a lattice of pastry strips across the top, but the most attractive versions include the shape of Liverpool's  Liver Bird in one form or another. It is possible to buy bespoke pastry cutters which can provide Liver Bird shapes in sugarpaste. While these produce the most attractive tarts, they do add yet another level of sweetness,  and the difficulty of removing each limb from the cutter makes this uneconomical in commercial terms. Another popular method is to acquire a flat Liver Bird shape or template, which can be rested on the surface while biscuit-crumb is dredged over the whole tart, then removal of the template leaves a dark Liver Bird in clear view. This is a much quicker process and adds much less extra sweetness.\n", "context_len": 455, "questions": ["Which fruit is traditionally used in the recipe for Liverpool Tart?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Dr Finlay", "Dr. Finlay", "Dr Findlay's Casebook", "Dr Finlay's Casebook", "Dr. Finlay's Casebook"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nGiverny\nGiverny is a commune in the Eure department in northern France. It is best known as the location of Claude Monet's garden and home.\n\nLocation\n\nGiverny sits on the \"right bank\" of the River Seine where the river Epte meets the Seine. The village lies 80 km from Paris, west and slightly north, in the old province of Normandy (it is officially in the d\u00e9partement of Eure, in the r\u00e9gion of Haute-Normandie).\n\nHistory\n\nA settlement has existed in Giverny since neolithic times and a monument uncovered attests to this fact. Archeological finds have included bootees dating from Gallo-Roman times and to the earlier 1st and 2nd centuries AD. The town was known in ancient deeds as \"Warnacum\". The cultivation of grapes has been an occupation of the inhabitants of Giverny since Merovingian times. The village church dates from the Middle Ages and is built partially in the Romanesque style, though additions have since been made. It is dedicated to Sainte-Radegonde. The village has remained a small rural setting with a modest population (numbering around 301 in 1883 when Monet discovered it) and has since seen a boom in tourism since the restoration of Monet's house and gardens.\n\nMonet at Giverny\n\nClaude Monet noticed the village of Giverny while looking out of a train window. He made up his mind to move there and rented a house and the area surrounding it. In 1890 he had enough money to buy the house and land outright and set out to create the magnificent gardens he wanted to paint. Some of his most famous paintings were of his garden in Giverny, famous for its rectangular Clos normand, with archways of climbing plants entwined around colored shrubs, and the water garden, formed by a tributary to the Epte, with the Japanese bridge, the pond with the water lilies, the wisterias and the azaleas.\n\nMonet lived in the house with its famous pink crushed brick fa\u00e7ade from 1883 until his death in 1926. He and many members of his family are interred in the village cemetery.\n\nThe Giverny Colony \n \n\nBeginning around 1887, a number of American Impressionist artists settled to work in Giverny, drawn by the landscapes, the overall atmosphere, and the presence of Monet. These included Willard Metcalf, Louis Ritter, Theodore Wendel, and John Leslie Breck.  Soon many American extended their visits from summer through the entire year.  American painter Theodore Earl Butler married Monet's stepdaughter and sometime-model Suzanne Hosched\u00e9 there in 1892.  \n\nFrederick Carl Frieseke spent every summer from 1906 through 1919 in a residence next door to Monet's.  The term Decorative Impressionism was coined in 1911 to describe Frieseke's work, and the term describes the work of a \"second wave\" of American painters in Giverny such as Richard E. Miller.  In December 1910, six of the Giverny artists (Frieseke, Miller, Lawton S. Parker, Guy Rose, Edmund Greacen and Karl Anderson) were given a show at the Madison Gallery in New York which termed them \"The Giverny Group.\"  \n\nWorld War I largely marked the end of the art colony.\n\nAttractions\n\nClaude Monet's property at Giverny (house and gardens), left by his son to the Acad\u00e9mie des Beaux-Arts in 1966, became a Museum opened to public visit in 1980 after completion of large-scale restoration work: the huge Nymphea's studio was restored and the precious collection of Japanese engravings was displayed in several rooms, hung in the manner chosen by the master himself; the gardens were replanted as they once were.  The house became a popular tourist attraction (the Claude Monet Foundation), particularly in the summer when the flowers are in bloom.\n\nThe other main attraction of the village is the Museum of Impressionism Giverny dedicated to the history of impressionism and its continuation in the Giverny art colony and along the valley of the river Seine.\n\nThe H\u00f4tel Baudy was a center of artistic life in the Giverny heyday. It is now still a caf\u00e9 and restaurant, with period decoration.\n\nPopulation\n", "context_len": 744, "questions": ["Which French painter famously designed a garden at his home in Giverny, in which he created many of his most famous paintings?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Nadine Elizabeth Louise Coyle", "Outta My Mind", "Nadine Coyle discography", "NADINE COYLE", "Girl On the Loose", "Nadine Coyle"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nSophie Dahl\nSophie Dahl (born Sophie Holloway; 15 September 1977) is an English author and former fashion model.  As a writer, she completed her first novella in 2003 entitled The Man with the Dancing Eyes and followed this with Playing With the Grown-ups in 2008. In 2010 she wrote Miss Dahl's Voluptuous Delights, a cookery book which featured recipes that were recreated for a six-part BBC 2 series called The Delicious Miss Dahl.\n\nBorn in London, Dahl made her debut on the English catwalk in London Fashion Week in the Autumn of 1997.  That year, she was discovered by Isabella Blow, who was then a stylist for Vogue magazine. Blow introduced her to the management at the Storm Model Agency in London who signed her to a number of modelling campaigns, including those for Versace, Alexander McQueen, Patrick Cox, DKNY, Boucheron and Pringle.\n\nDahl is the daughter of actor Julian Holloway and writer Tessa Dahl. Her maternal grandparents were the children's author Roald Dahl and the  American actress Patricia Neal. Her paternal grandparents were the actor Stanley Holloway and the former chorus dancer Violet Lane. Dahl was the inspiration for Sophie, the main character in her maternal grandfather's book The BFG. She is married to the singer Jamie Cullum.\n\nEarly life \n\nDahl was born Sophie Holloway in London  to the actor Julian Holloway and the writer Tessa Dahl. As a child, Sophie led a turbulent lifestyle; she attended 10 schools and lived in 17 homes in various locations including London, New York, and India.  Dahl often spent time at both her maternal and paternal grandparents' houses in Great Missenden \nand Angmering respectively.  Dahl has noted that her childhood was \"an odd one, but with such magic\".\n\nCareer \n\nModelling \n\nDahl became interested in modelling after a chance meeting with the Vogue stylist Isabella Blow on the streets of West London.  Blow found Dahl crying after an argument with her parents over her reluctance to study art history. Blow consoled her and  introduced her to Sarah Doukas of the Storm Model Agency. Dahl made her modelling debut on the catwalk of Lainey Keogh's first major show, in London Fashion Week for Autumn 1997.  Under their management, Dahl appeared in campaigns for Versace, Alexander McQueen, Patrick Cox, Pringle, and Gap, among others. \n\nDahl has worked with numerous notable photographers, including Richard Avedon, David Bailey, Peter Lindbergh, Bruce Weber, Steven Klein and Steven Meisel.  Over the course of her career, she appeared in many editorials for high fashion magazines such as Visionaire, French and German Vogue, W, ID and V magazine. In 1997 she appeared with Kate Moss in the Elton John music video \"Something About the Way You Look Tonight\".  In 2000, Dahl became the face of Yves Saint-Laurent's Opium. The ad, art-directed by Tom Ford and shot by Steven Meisel, was a photograph of Dahl with cherry red hair posing nude on black satin. It was removed from UK billboards after complaints were made to the Advertising Standards Authority.  Accused of sexually objectifying women, it is in the top ten most-complained about advertisements of all time.  Dahl responded to the criticism: \"I think the photograph is beautiful... it was seen as being anti-women, when in fact I think it is very empowering to women\".   In 2012, Dahl was announced as the new face of Aubin & Wills.\n\nWriting \n\nDahl has written extensively for Vogue, and in November 2012, she won a Jasmine award for her column about scent.  In 2003 Dahl completed her first book, The Man with the Dancing Eyes, published by Bloomsbury Publishing.  After this she began writing regularly for publications such as American Vogue, The Guardian, The Telegraph, The Observer and the Saturday Times. \n\nFrom 2005 Dahl was a contributing editor and regular columnist at Men's Vogue, prior to its closure in 2008. Dahl is the author of three other books: Playing with the Grown-Ups (2008)  and two cook books, Miss Dahl's Voluptuous Delights (2009)  and From Season To Season (2011).  She was a contributor to an anthology, Truth or Dare edited by Justine Picardie, which included works by Zo\u00eb Heller and William Fiennes.  Dahl provided introductions to the Puffin Classic new edition of The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett,  the Virago Press re-issue of Stella Gibbons' 1938 novel Nightingale Wood which was released in April 2009, and Nancy Mitford's \"Don't Tell Alfred\", reissued by Penguin in March 2010. \n\nDuring March and April 2010, Dahl wrote and presented a six-part cookery series entitled The Delicious Miss Dahl, which was broadcast on BBC 2. The following year, she filmed a documentary about the Victorian cook, Isabella Beeton which was transmitted on BBC2. \n\nPersonal life \n\nDahl comes from an artistic background, with notable grandparents on both sides. Her paternal grandparents were the actor Stanley Holloway and the former chorus dancer Violet Lane.  Her paternal lineage has been associated with the stage since 1850; Charles Bernard (1830\u20131894), an ancestor, was a successful Shakespearean actor and theatre manager both in London and the English provinces. Bernard's son, Oliver Percy Bernard OBE MC (1881\u20131939), was an English architect and scenic designer, responsible for the sets for Sir Thomas Beecham's Ring Cycle at Covent Garden.  Her maternal grandparents were the author Roald Dahl and the American actress Patricia Neal. \n\nOn 9 January 2010 Dahl married the singer Jamie Cullum.  They had their first child, a daughter named Lyra, on 2 March 2011;  she was followed by a second daughter, Margot, on 4 March 2013.

{"context": "\nAstraphobia\nAstraphobia, also known as astrapophobia, brontophobia, keraunophobia, or tonitrophobia, or nicaduranaphobia, is an abnormal fear of thunder and lightning, a type of specific phobia. It is a treatable phobia that both humans and animals can develop. The term astraphobia derives from the Greek words \u1f00\u03c3\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ae (astrape; lightning) and \u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 (phobos; fear). \n\nSymptoms\n\nA person with astraphobia will often feel anxious during a thunderstorm even when they understand that the threat to them is minimal. Some symptoms are those accompanied with many phobias, such as trembling, crying, sweating, panicked reactions, the sudden feeling of using the bathroom, nausea, the feeling of dread, and rapid heartbeat. However, there are some reactions that are unique to astraphobia. For instance, reassurance from other people is usually sought, and symptoms worsen when alone. Many people who have astraphobia will look for extra shelter from the storm.  They might hide underneath a bed, under the covers, in a closet, in a basement, or any other space where they feel safer. Efforts are usually made to smother the sound of the thunder; the person may cover their ears or curtain the windows.\n\nA sign that someone has astraphobia is a very heightened interest in weather forecasts. An astraphobic person will be alert for news of incoming storms. They may watch the weather on television constantly during rainy bouts and may even track thunderstorms online. This can become severe enough that the person may not go outside without checking the weather first. In very extreme cases, astraphobia can lead to agoraphobia, the fear of leaving the home.\n\nChildren\n\nA 2007 study found astraphobia the third most prevalent phobia in the US.  It can occur in people of any age. It occurs in many children, and should not be immediately identified as a phobia because children naturally go through many fears as they mature. Their fear of thunder and lightning cannot be considered a fully developed phobia unless it persists for more than six months. In this case, the child's phobia should be addressed, for it may become a serious problem in adulthood.\n\nTo lessen a child's fear during thunderstorms, the child can be distracted by games and activities. A bolder approach is to treat the storm as an entertainment; a fearless adult is an excellent role model for children. Sometimes children cannot be attracted to video games and activities while a thunderstorm is happening. Some children usually go to basements and other places that are quiet or places that have no windows.\n\nTreatment\n\nThe most widely used and possibly the most effective treatment for astraphobia is exposure to thunderstorms and eventually building an immunity. Cognitive behavioral therapy is also often used to treat astraphobia.  The patient will in many cases be instructed to repeat phrases to himself or herself in order to become calm during a storm. Heavy breathing exercises can reinforce this effort.\n\nDogs and cats\n\nDogs may exhibit severe anxiety during thunderstorms; between 15 and 30 percent may be affected. Research confirms high levels of cortisol - a hormone associated with stress - affects dogs during and after thunderstorms. Remedies include behavioral therapies such as counter conditioning and desensitization, anti-anxiety medications, and Dog Appeasing Pheromone, a synthetic analogue of a hormone secreted by nursing canine mothers. \n\nStudies have also shown that cats can be afraid of thunderstorms. Whilst it is very rare, cats have been known to hide under a table or behind a couch during a thunderstorm. \n\nGenerally if any animal is anxious during a thunderstorm or any similar, practically harmless event (e.g. fireworks display), it is advised to simply continue behaving normally, instead of attempting to comfort animals. Showing fearlessness is, arguably, the best method to \"cure\" the anxiety.\n", "context_len": 706, "questions": ["Of what does someone suffering from brontophobia have an irrational fear?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Dame Shirley Bassey DBE", "The Love Album (Shirley Bassey album)", "Dame Shirley Bassey", "Shirley Bassey", "Shirley Veronica Bassey", "Shirley Bassett", "Dame Shirley Veronica Bassey", "Shirley Bassie", "Burly Chassis"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nKing of the Wind\nKing of the Wind is a novel by Marguerite Henry that won the Newbery Medal for excellence in American children's literature in 1949.  It was made into a film of the same name in 1990. \n\nPlot\n\nThe novel is a fictionalised biography of the Godolphin Arabian, an ancestor of the modern Thoroughbred. The story starts with Man o' War's victory over Sir Barton in a race. The fans expect Man o' War to race at Newmarket, but his owner, Samuel Riddle, chooses to end his racing career early. When questioned about his decision, he tells the story of the Godolphin Arabian.\n\nThe story starts in Morocco, as the fast of Ramadan is ending with the setting sun. The boys in the Sultan's stables begin to hungrily feast, but Agba, a mute orphan, ignores the end of the fast and continues to tend to his favorite Arabian mare. She refuses to eat, even though all the horses were forced to participate in the Ramadan fast along with the humans, and Agba worries for her. The Chief Groom realizes this, and that tonight is her birthing hour.\n\nAgba, sleeping in the mare's stall, wakes to find a new foal in the stable. He notices a white spot on the colt's hind heel, considered the emblem of swiftness and good luck. The Chief Groom, upon entering the stall spots a wheat ear on the foal's chest: a sign of bad luck. He attempts to kill the colt, but Agba intervenes and points out the white spot. The Chief Groom considers this, then leaves, prophesying that the mare will die. Agba, undaunted, names the colt Sham because of his golden coat.\n\nWithin a few days, the prophecy is fulfilled when the mare dies. Agba attempts to run away from the stables, but is knocked into a camel. This gives him an idea, and he feeds Sham on camel's milk and wild honey, promising that someday he will be King of The Wind.\n\nSham matures into a promising racehorse, beating all of the other horses in the stable. He sees Agba as a mother, and they develop a close bond. One day, the Sultan summons six horseboys to his palace, including Agba, and charges them to accompany six horses that are to be given as gifts to the French king. One horse is to be chestnut, one yellow dun, one dark gray, one white, one black, and one bay touched with gold. Sham fits the requirements for the bay horse and accompanies Agba to France. The horseboy is to remain with that horse until death, then return to Morocco.\n\nHowever, the supposedly great racehorses are frowned upon by the French, who believe that they are not 'lusty' enough to be racehorses. Five of the horses are sent back to Morocco, but Sham remains behind to be a kitchen horse. He does not take to this work well, and when Agba is gone one afternoon, Sham causes such a mess that the cook sells him.\n\nAgba searches desperately for Sham, finally finding him pulling water in the streets of Paris. He becomes a slave to Sham's owner  and meets Grimalkin the cat along the way.\n\nSham is bought by a Quaker man and taken to England. He refuses to have the Quaker's nephew ride him and is sold to an inn. When Agba is caught sneaking in to see the horse, he goes to jail. The jailer destroys Sham's pedigree. Fortunately, Agba is bailed out by the Quaker's housekeeper, who is quite fond of him, and Sham is released from his cruel treatment at the inn. The housekeeper finds him a job with the Earl of Godolphin.\n\nThe Earl treats Sham as a workhorse, albeit kindly. The true celebrity in the Godolphin stables is the stallion Hobgoblin, whom Sham detests. Lady Roxana, a mate meant for Hobgoblin, arrives, and Sham successfully fights Hobgoblin for her. Lady Roxana enjoys Sham's company, but the Earl is embarrassed by the incident. He sentences Sham, Agba, and Grimalkin to life in Wicken Fen, and they depart.\n\nTwo years later, the Earl's Chief Groom comes to see Agba and reveals that Lady Roxana gave birth to Sham's son Lath, who was left alone and untrained due to his skinniness. Lath, however, one day jumped a fence and outran some of the colts that the Earl was training, proving his worth.\n\nThe trio come back to Godolphin, and Sham is named the Godolphin Arabian. He has two more foals with Lady Roxana: Cade and Regulus. After the Earl reveals that he is near bankruptcy, they race Sham's sons at Newmarket. They win the races and the Queen's purse, and Agba contemplates his life with Sham.\n\nAs a footnote, it is revealed the Godolphin Arabian lived long and had many successful descendants. The Earl left his grave blank, and Agba returned to Morocco.

The first book, The Bornless Keeper, appeared in 1974, quickly followed by Hazell plays Solomon the same year.\n\n\"Hazell plays Solomon\" was the first episode of the TV series. The wise-cracking private detective was played by Nicholas Ball. Hazell was a smart parody of earlier film-noir detectives such as Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade, the casting of Ball in the title role made for a younger TV Hazell than the printed Hazell.\n\nA Thames Television Network Production, Hazell ran for 22 one-hour-long episodes (50 minutes without adverts). Its theme music was composed by Andy Mackay; the end credits incorporated the theme music with added lyrics, written by Judy Forrest and sung by Maggie Bell. An academic work, Hazell: The Making of a TV Series by Manuel Alvarado and Edward Buscombe (BFI Publishing) appeared in March 1978.\n\nCast\n\nThe main and most frequent cast members were:\n*Nicholas Ball as James 'Jim' Hazell\n*Roddy McMillan as Detective Inspector 'Choc' Minty\n*Desmond McNamara as Cousin Tel\n*Peter Bourke as Graham Morris\n*Barbara Young as Dot Wilmington (Series 1 only)\n*Maggie Riley as Maureen (Series 1 only)\n\nEpisodes (by series) \n\n*Series 1\n**1. \"Hazell Plays Solomon\" (16 January 1978)\n**2. \"Hazell Pays a Debt\" (23 January 1978)\n**3. \"Hazell and the Walking Blur\" (30 January 1978)\n**4. \"Hazell Settles the Accounts\" (6 February 1978)\n**5. \"Hazell Meets the First Eleven\" (13 February 1978)\n**6. \"Hazell and the Rubber-Heel Brigade\" (20 February 1978)\n**7. \"Hazell Goes to the Dogs\" (27 February 1978)\n**8. \"Hazell and the Weekend Man\" (6 March 1978)\n**9. \"Hazell Works for Nothing\" (13 March 1978)\n**10. \"Hazell and the Maltese Vulture\" (20 March 1978)\n*Series 2\n**1. \"Hazell and the Baker Street Sleuth\" (19 April 1979)\n**2. \"Hazell and the Deptford Virgin\" (26 April 1979)\n**3. \"Hazell Bangs the Drum\" (3 May 1979)\n**4. \"Hazell Gets the Boot\" (10 May 1979)\n**5. \"Hazell Gets the Bird\" (17 May 1979)\n**6. \"Hazell and the Big Sleep\" (24 May 1979)\n**7.(*) \"Hazell and the Suffolk Ghost\" (31 May 1979)\n**8. \"Hazell and Hyde\" (7 June 1979)\n**9. \"Hazell and the Happy Couple\" (14 June 1979)\n**10. \"Hazell Gets the Part\" (21 June 1979)\n**11. \"Hazell and the Greasy Gunners\" (28 June 1979)\n**12.(*) \"Hazell and the Public Enemy\" (5 July 1979)\n\n(*) = Although broadcast as listed, continuity involving the destruction of Hazell's original Triumph Stag car and its replacement with a Jaguar Mark 2, indicates that episode 7 should have been twelfth, and episode 12 should have been ninth (after \"Hazell and the Happy Couple\", when the Stag is attacked by an angry client).\n", "context_len": 698, "questions": ["Which former footballer and manager co-wrote the UK television series \u2018Hazell\u2019?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Vivaldi", "A.Vivaldi", "Antonio Lucio Vivaldi", "The Red Priest", "A.

{"context": "\nSargassum\nSargassum is a genus of brown (class Phaeophyceae) macroalgae (seaweed) in the order Fucales. Numerous species are distributed throughout the temperate and tropical oceans of the world, where they generally inhabit shallow water and coral reefs, and the genus is widely known for its planktonic (free-floating) species. While most species within the class Phaeophyceae are predominantly cold water organisms that benefit from nutrients upwelling, genus Sargassum appears to be an exception to this general rule.  Any number of the normally benthic species may take on a planktonic, often pelagic existence after being removed from reefs during rough weather; however, two species (S. natans and S. fluitans) have become holopelagic\u2014reproducing vegetatively and never attaching to the seafloor during their lifecycle. The Atlantic Ocean's Sargasso Sea was named after the algae, as it hosts a large amount of sargassum. \n\nHistory\n\nSargassum was named by the Portuguese sailors who found it in the Sargasso Sea after a species of rock rose (Helianthemum) that grew in their water wells at home and that was called sarga\u00e7o in Portuguese. \n\nThe Florida Keys and its smaller islands are well known for their high levels of Sargassum covering their shores. Gulfweed was observed by Columbus. Although it was formerly thought to cover the entirety of the Sargasso Sea, making navigation impossible, it has since been found to occur only in drifts. \n\nSargassum is also cultivated and cleaned for use as an herbal remedy. Many Chinese herbalists prescribe powdered Sargassum, either the species S. pallidum, or more rarely, hijiki, S. fusiforme, in doses of 0.5 gram, to be dissolved in warm water and drunk as a tea. It is called \"hai zao\" in Traditional Chinese Medicine, where it is used to resolve \"heat phlegm.\" \n\nDescription \n\nSpecies of this genus of algae may grow to a length of several metres. They are generally brown or dark green in color and consist of a holdfast, a stipe, and a frond. Oogonia and antheridia occur in conceptacles embedded in receptacles on special branches.  Some species have berrylike gas-filled bladders which help keep the fronds afloat to promote photosynthesis. Many have a rough sticky texture, which together with a robust but flexible body, helps it to withstand strong water currents.\n\nEcology \n\nThe thick masses of Sargassum provide an environment for a distinctive and specialised group of marine animals and plants, many of which are not found elsewhere.\n\nSargassum is commonly found in the beach drift near Sargassum beds where they are also known as gulfweed, a term also used to include all seaweed species washed up on shore.\n\nSargassum species are found throughout tropical areas of the world and are often the most obvious macrophyte in near-shore areas where Sargassum beds often occur near coral reefs. The plants grow subtidally and attach to coral, rocks or shells in moderately exposed or sheltered rocky or pebble areas. These tropical populations often undergo seasonal cycles of growth and decay in concert with seasonal changes in sea temperature.   In some cases (e.g., the Sargasso Sea) there are floating populations of Sargassum.\n\nIn tropical Sargassum species that are often preferentially consumed by herbivorous fishes and echinoids, there is a relatively low level of phenolics and tannins. \n\nSargassum muticum\n\nSargassum muticum is a large brown seaweed of the class Phaeophyceae.  It grows attached to rocks by a perennial holdfast up to 5\u00a0cm in diameter. From this holdfast the main axis grows to a maximum  of 5\u00a0cm high. The leaf-like laminae and primary lateral branches grow from this stipe. In warm waters it can grow to 12 m long, however in British waters it gives rise to a single main axis with secondary and tertiary branches which are shed annually. Numerous small 2\u20136\u00a0mm stalked air vesicles provide buoyancy. The reproductive receptacles are also stalked and develop in the axils of leafy laminae. It is self-fertile.\n\nDistribution\n\nSouth coast of England and several sites in the south of Ireland.\n\nSargassum adrift in Gulf Stream\n\n \n\nSargassum crisis in the Caribbean Sea\n\nIn the summer of 2015, large quantities of different species of Sargassum accumulated along the shores of many of the countries bathed by the Caribbean Sea. Some of the affected islands and regions include the Caribbean coast of Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Barbados and Tobago  The aquatic plant washes ashore, piles up on beaches, and decays, often causing a foul odor. The affected countries and territories are discussing causes of the outbreak, potential solutions, and the negative affects on tourism.  Researchers say that the Sargassum outbreak started in 2011, but it has become worse over the years. There are several factors that could explain the proliferation of Sargassum in the area in recent years. These include the rise of sea temperature and the change of sea currents due to climate change. Also, nutriments from agricultural fertilizers and wastewater from the cities, that end up in the sea, could also make the algae bloom.\n", "context_len": 913, "questions": ["Sargassum is what type of plant?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["UN/LOCODE:ITFLR", "Folrenz", "Firenze, Italy", "\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e0\u05e6\u05d4", "Montughi", "Firenze", "Gualfonda", "FLORENCE", "Florentine", "Frorence", "Florence (Italy)", "Florence", "Florence, Italy"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

Cream is sometimes used as well. It is a basic preparation used in stuffings and sauces (notably, beef Wellington) or as a garnish. Duxelles can also be filled into a pocket of raw pastry and baked as a savory tart. \n\nDuxelles is made with any cultivated or wild mushroom, depending on the recipe. Duxelles made with wild porcini mushrooms will be much stronger flavored than that made with white or brown mushrooms.\n\nDuxelles is said to have been created by the 17th-century French chef Fran\u00e7ois Pierre La Varenne (1615\u20131678) and to have been named after his employer, Nicolas Chalon du Bl\u00e9, marquis d'Uxelles, mar\u00e9chal de France.\n\nMany classical cookbooks define duxelles as dehydrated fungi, used as stuffings and pastry fillings. According to Auguste Escoffier (1847\u20131935), a world-renowned French chef regarded as the father of classical cuisine, the mushrooms were dehydrated in order to enhance flavor and minimize water content.  When fresh mushrooms are cooked, they let off enormous amounts of vapor in relation to their size.  Fresh mushrooms used as stuffings or pastry fillings could therefore build up pressure inside the dish or pastry, causing it to crack or even explode.\n", "context_len": 249, "questions": ["What is the main ingredient of Duxelles sauce or Duxelles stuffing?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["English inch", "Inch (unit)", "International inch", "Decimal inch", "U.S. survey inch", "Inches", "Ynch", "\u33cc", "Scottish inch", "Decimal Inch", "Inch (Scottish length)", "Inch", "Inch (length)", "Inch (Scots)", "Scots inch", "In (unit)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nAbsorption of Water and Electrolytes\nAbsorption of Water and Electrolytes\nGlossary\nAbsorption of Water and Electrolytes\nThe small intestine must absorb massive quantities of water.  A normal person or animal of similar size takes in roughly 1 to 2 liters of dietary fluid every day.  On top of that, another 6 to 7 liters of fluid is received by the small intestine daily as secretions from salivary glands, stomach, pancreas, liver and the small intestine itself.\nBy the time the ingesta enters the large intestine, approximately 80% of this fluid has been absorbed. Net movement of water across cell membranes always occurs by osmosis , and the fundamental concept needed to understand absorption in the small gut is that there is a tight coupling between water and solute absorption. Another way of saying this is that absorption of water is absolutely dependent on absorption of solutes, particularly sodium:\nSodium is absorbed into the cell by several mechanisms, but chief among them is by cotransport with glucose and amino acids - this means that efficient sodium absorption is dependent on absorption of these organic solutes.\nAbsorbed sodium is rapidly exported from the cell via sodium pumps - when a lot of sodium is entering the cell, a lot of sodium is pumped out of the cell, which establishes a high osmolarity in the small intercellular spaces between adjacent enterocytes.\nWater diffuses in response to the osmotic gradient established by sodium - in this case into the intercellular space.  It seems that the bulk of the water absorption is transcellular, but some also diffuses through the tight junctions.\nWater, as well as sodium, then diffuses into capillary blood within the villus.\nExamine the animation above and consider the osmotic gradient between the lumen and the intercellular space (inside the villus).  As sodium (green balls) is rapidly pumped out of the cell, it achieves very high concentration in the narrow space between enterocytes.  The osmotic gradient is thus formed across apical cell membranes and their connecting junctional complexes.  The arrow that appears denotes movement of water across the epithelium.\nWater is thus absorbed into the intercellular space by diffusion down an osmotic gradient.  However, looking at the process as a whole, transport of water from lumen to blood is often against an osmotic gradient - this is important because it means that the intestine can absorb water into blood even when the osmolarity in the lumen is higher than osmolarity of blood.\nThis ability is best explained by the \" three compartment model \" for absorption of water and, like many aspects of gut permeability, varies along the length of the gut.  The proximal small intestine functions as a highly permeable mixing segment, and absorption of water is basically isotonic.  That is, water is not absorbed until the ingesta has been diluted out to just above the osmolarity of blood.  The ileum and especially the colon are able to absorb water against an osmotic gradient of several hundred milliosmols.\n", "context_len": 541, "questions": ["Which part of the gut absorbs water from thje food?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Kim Smith", "Smith, Kim", "Kimberley Smith", "Kimberly Smith", "Kimberley Smith (athlete)", "Kimberley Smith (disambiguation)", "Kim Smith (disambiguation)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nSpinning frame\nThe spinning frame is an Industrial Revolution invention for spinning thread or yarn from fibres such as wool or cotton in a mechanized way.  It was developed in 18th-century Britain by Richard Arkwright and John Kay.\n\nHistorical context\n\nIn 1760 England, yarn production from wool, flax and cotton was still a cottage industry in which fibres were carded and spun by hand using a spinning wheel.  As the textile industry expanded its markets and adopted faster machines, yarn supplies became scarce especially due to innovations such as the doubling of the loom speed after the invention of the flying shuttle.  High demand for yarn spurred invention of the spinning jenny in 1764, followed closely by the invention of the spinning frame, later developed into the water frame (patented in 1769).  Mechanisms had increased production of yarn so dramatically that by 1830 the yarn cottage industry in England could no longer compete and all spinning was carried out in factories. \n\nDevelopment\n\nRichard Arkwright employed John Kay to produce a new spinning machine that Kay had worked on with (or possibly stolen from) another inventor called Thomas Highs.   With the help of other local craftsmen the team produced the spinning frame, which produced a stronger thread than the spinning jenny produced by James Hargreaves.  The frame employed the draw rollers invented by Lewis Paul to stretch, or attenuate, the yarn.  \n\nThe roller spinning process starts with a thick 'string' of lose fibers called a roving, which is passed between three pairs of rollers, each pair rotating slightly faster than the previous one. In this way it is reduced in thickness and increased in length before a strengthening twist is added by a bobbin-and-flyer mechanism.  The spacing of the rollers has to be slightly greater than the fiber length to prevent breakage. The nip of the roller pairs prevent the twist from backing up to the roving.\n\nToo large to be operated by hand, the spinning frame needed a new source of power.  Arkwright at first experimented with horses, but decided to employ the power of the water wheel, which gave the invention the name 'water frame'.  \n\nFor some time, the stronger yarn produced by the spinning frame was used in looms for the lengthwise \"warp\" threads that bound cloth together, while hand powered jennies provided the weaker yarn used for the horizontal filler \"weft\" threads.  The jennies required skill but was inexpensive and could be used in a home.  The spinning frames required significant capital but required little skill.\n", "context_len": 462, "questions": ["Which English inventor was responsible for the introduction of the multi-spool spinning frame known as the Spinning Jenny in1764?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Sea bird", "Marine birds", "Sea-bird", "Marine bird", "Seabirds", "Sea birds", "Sea-birds", "Sea-fowl", "Seabird", "Seafowl"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nHeelflip\nThe heelflip (aka heel), is an aerial skateboarding trick where the skateboarder kicks out in front of him/her flipping board 360 degrees along the board's long axis.\n\nA heelflip is executed similarly to the ollie, and like the Ollie has become a defining trick of \"New School\" skateboarding.\n\nExecution\n\nA heelflip is the opposite of a kickflip, the board spins toe-side (towards the toes). For a regular skater (left foot in front) the board spins clockwise from the perspective of one behind the skater. Again, there is a kick as part of the ollie but unlike the kickflip it is directed forward and outwards away from the rider's toe side (diagonal), so that the last part of the foot to leave the board is the heel, hence the name.\n\nWhile the heelflip is similar to the ollie, it is not a direct variation of the ollie.  In performing a standard heelflip you will see the skateboarder: \n*Places his or her front foot behind or on the front bolts of the board and towards the heel-side edge of the board.\n*The skater pushes the ball of the back foot on the tail of the board slightly angled initiating the \"pop\" and a slight spin. \n*The rider's front foot is slid out diagonally in order to start the board rotating while the shoulders are centered over the board.\n*His or her feet are lifted out of the way so that their board can spin completely.\n*The rider catches their board and roll away. Skateboarders considered it good execution of the trick to stop the board's rotation with the feet in midair rather than to allow contact with the ground to stop the board.\n\nVariations\n\nVariations and extensions of the standard heelflip are very common - some of these are:\n\n*Double Heelflip, where the board flips twice before being caught.\n*Triple Heelflip, where the board flips three times before being caught.\n*Heelflip Body Varial,(not to be confused with the disco flip, in which a riders performs a sex change 180 while executing a Kickflip), where the skater does a backside 180 turn, while the board does not spin, but still flips.\n*Varial Heelflip, where the board does one heel flip, and spins 180 degrees frontside (frontside pop shove-it) at the same time.\n*Laser flip, a combination of the Frontside 360 pop shove-it and the Heelflip. The opposite of a 360 flip.\n*Late Front-Foot Heelflip, in which the tail is snapped and the ollie is pursued but, at the peak of the ollie the heel of the front foot pushes downward on the toe-side edge of the board causing it to rotate once.\n*Late Heelflip, in which the rider does an Ollie, and at the peak of their air they flick their back foot resulting in a Heelflip.\n*The Heelflip Grab, a variation on grabs where the rider flips the board and catches it with his hand rather than the feet. It was first done on a vertical ramp but now is very commonly seen done on launch ramps or other surfaces which can generate sufficient air time.\n*Inward Heelflip, a combination of the backside pop shove-it and the Heelflip, this trick is usually executed with the crossing of the skater's legs. The opposite of a Hardflip.\n*Bigspin Heel, the skaters body does a frontside 180 while their board does a laser flip.\n", "context_len": 649, "questions": ["Heel flip, kick flip, and ollie are tricks in which action sport?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Seasons in the Sun", "Seasons In the Sun", "Sommar varje dag", "Seasons In The Sun", "Le Moribond", "Seasons in the sun"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nCassiopeia Constellation on Top Astronomer\nCassiopeia Constellation on Top Astronomer\nCassiopeia\nPlease hover over any star to get more information\nCassiopeia is a constellation in the northern hemisphere, first charted by the Greek astronomer Ptolemy in the 2nd century. It is taken to represent the queen Cassiopeia of the mythical kingdom Ethiopia. In Greek mythology, Cassiopeia offended the Nereids (sea nymphs) by boasting about being more beautiful than them. As punishment for her vanity, she had to sacrifice her daughter Andromeda to appease the sea monster Cetus sent by Poseidon. It is said that, once placed in the sky, Cassiopeia was condemned to circle the celestial pole forever, sometimes hanging upside down, as additional punishment. The constellation is quite easy to spot in the sky because five of its bright stars form a distinctive 'W' shape.\nThe constellation Cassiopeia occupies an area of 598 square degrees and contains three stars with known planets. It can be seen at latitudes between +90\u00b0 and -20\u00b0 and is best visible at 9 p.m. during the month of November.\n[1959] beta Cassiopeiae or Caph (\"palm\") is a yellow-white giant with a magnitude of 2.28, classified as a Delta Scuti type variable. It is twice the size of the Sun and 28 times brighter.\n[1878] alpha Cassiopeiae, Shedir or Shedar (\"the breast\") has a magnitude of 2.25 and is the second brightest star in the constellation. It is an orange giant more than 500 times brighter than the Sun.\n[1880] gamma Cassiopeiae is the central star of the constellation. It is an eruptive variable star. It does not have a traditional Latin or Arabic name, but the Chinesse call it Tsih (\"the whip\"). At maximum intensity (currently 2.15), the star outshines both alpha and beta Cassiopeiae. Gamma Cassiopeiae spins very rapidly and bulges along the equator, which causes it to lose mass. As a result, a disk forms around the star which is responsible for the variations in brightness and emissions.\n[1881] delta Cassiopeiae, also known as Ksora or Ruchbah (\"knee\") is an eclipsing binary star about 99 light-years distant. It has an apparent visual magnitude that varies between 2.68 and 2.71.\n[1882] epsilon Cassiopeiae, also called Segin, is a blue-white giant about 442 light-years away from Earth. Its luminosity is 720 times that of the Sun.\n[1891] rho Cassiopeiae and V509 Cassiopeiae are among the most luminous stars visible to the naked eye in the galaxy. [1883] eta Cassiopeiae is a binary star consisting of a yellow dwarf similar to our Sun and an orange dwarf.\nCassiopeia also has two notable Messier objects, both open star clusters. Messier 52 or NGC 7654 was discovered by Charles Messier in 1774 and can be seen with binoculars. In stronger telescopes, it appears as a rich, V-shaped cluster of faint stars with a bright yellow star on the edge.\nMessier 103 or NGC 581 was the last Messier object to be catalogued by Charles Messier himself. At about 8,000 light-years away, it is one of the more remote open clusters to be catalogued. It contains between 40 and 50 stars, the brightest one of which is Struve 131 or HD 9311. The cluster is faint, but once found, it has the appearance of curving star chains streaming outward from the centre.\nTycho's Star or CN 1572, observed as a supernova in 1572 and documented by the Danish nobleman and astronomer Tycho Brahe, is also located in Cassiopeia. The star named Tycho G is being studied as a possible companion to the star that created the supernova. The other supernova remnant in the constellation is Cassiopeia A, the strongest radio source outside our solar system that can be observed. The cloud of material left over from the supernova is now about 10 light-years across.\nFinally, the constellation contains an irregular galaxy, IC 10, first discovered by Lewis Swift in 1887. It is somewhat difficult to study because, located near the Milky Way plane, it is obscured by interstellar matter. With an exceptionally high rate of star formation, however, IC 10 is known as the only starburst galaxy in the Local Group.\n", "context_len": 791, "questions": ["In which constellation do the five main stars form a 'W' shape?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Dakota", "Dakota (disambiguation)", "DakotaS"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nChrist of Saint John of the Cross\nChrist of Saint John of the Cross is a painting by Salvador Dal\u00ed made in 1951. It depicts Jesus Christ on the cross in a darkened sky floating over a body of water complete with a boat and fishermen. Although it is a depiction of the crucifixion, it is devoid of nails, blood, and a crown of thorns, because, according to Dal\u00ed, he was convinced by a dream that these features would mar his depiction of Christ. Also in a dream, the importance of depicting Christ in the extreme angle evident in the painting was revealed to him.\n\nTitle\n\nThe painting is known as the Christ of Saint John of the Cross, because its design is based on a drawing by the 16th-century Spanish friar John of the Cross. The composition of Christ is also based on a triangle and circle (the triangle is formed by Christ's arms; the circle is formed by Christ's head). The triangle, since it has three sides, can be seen as a reference to the Trinity, and the circle may be an allusion to Platonic thought. The circle represents Unity: all things do exist in the \"three\" but in the four, merry they be. \n\nInspiration\n\nOn the bottom of his studies for the painting, Dal\u00ed explained its inspiration: \"In the first place, in 1950, I had a 'cosmic dream' in which I saw this image in colour and which in my dream represented the 'nucleus of the atom.'  This nucleus later took on a metaphysical sense; I considered it 'the very unity of the universe,' the Christ!\" \n\nIn order to create the figure of Christ, Dal\u00ed had Hollywood stuntman Russell Saunders suspended from an overhead gantry, so he could see how the body would appear from the desired angle  and also envisage the pull of gravity on the human body. The depicted body of water is the bay of Port Lligat, Dal\u00ed's residence at the time of the painting. \n\nHistory\n\nThe painting and intellectual property rights were acquired for Glasgow Corporation in the early 1950s by Tom Honeyman, then the Director of Glasgow Museums. Honeyman got the painting for \u00a38,200, a price considered high at the time although it was less than the \u00a312,000 catalogue price, and included the copyright, which has earned Glasgow Museums back the original cost many times over.\n\nThe purchase was controversial. A petition against the purchase, arguing that the money should be spent on exhibition space for local artists, was presented to the City Council by students at Glasgow School of Art.  The controversy caused Honeyman and Dal\u00ed to become friends, corresponding with each other for many years after the original events.\n\nThe painting first went on display at the city's Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum on 23 June 1952. In 1961, a visitor attacked the painting with a stone and tore the canvas with his hands. It was successfully restored over several months by conservators at Kelvingrove and returned to public display.  In 1993, the painting was moved to the city's St Mungo Museum of Religious Life and Art, but returned to Kelvingrove for its reopening in July 2006. It won a poll to decide Scotland's favourite painting in 2006, with 29% of the vote. \n\nCritical reception\n\nThis painting has continued to generate controversy. At the time of its purchase by Honeyman, the verdict by Modern Art critics was that producing such a traditional painting was a stunt by an artist already famous for his surrealist art. In 2009 the Guardian art critic, Jonathan Jones, described it as \"kitsch and lurid,\" but noted that the painting was \"for better or worse, probably the most enduring vision of the crucifixion painted in the 20th century.\"\n\nIn May 2013, in BBC Radio 4's Great Lives, British poet John Cooper Clarke described this image as being utterly different from any other image of the crucifixion, as the angle of view conveys the hanging pain of this method of execution, whilst hiding the ordinarily clich\u00e9d facial expressions normally seen in such depictions. \n\nSpanish offer\n\nThe Spanish government is said to have offered \u00a380 million ($127 million USD) for the painting, but the offer was turned down.\n", "context_len": 795, "questions": ["Which 20th century artist's works include 'Christ Of St. John Of The Cross' and 'Metamorphosis Of Narcissus'?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Synthetic emerald", "Emerald", "Emeralds", "Trapiche emerald", "Smaragdos", "The Emerald Streak"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nFolly to Be Wise\nFolly to Be Wise is a 1953 British comedy film directed by Frank Launder and starring Alastair Sim, Elizabeth Allan, Roland Culver, Colin Gordon, Martita Hunt and Edward Chapman. It is based on the play It Depends What You Mean by James Bridie.  The film follows the efforts of a British Army Chaplain attempting to recruit entertainment acts to perform for the troops and the complications that ensue when he does.  The title is taken from the line by Thomas Gray \"where ignorance is bliss, 'tis folly to be wise\".\n\nPlot\n\t\nHaving recently taken over the role of entertainments officer at an army camp the Padre Captain William Paris is disheartened so few of the troops turn out for an evening of classical music. He visits a local pub and finds the place packed with soldiers, including his own driver. He then resolves to try and secure something more entertaining for the troops and comes up with the idea of bringing in a Brain Trust to answer questions from the audience.\n\nWith the help of Lady Dodds, the Captain manages to gather together a group of local notables, who all swiftly prove to be mildly eccentric. The group includes the opinionated Professor Mutch, who is a popular radio personality with the BBC, and his friend the oil painter George Prout and his wife Angela. While arriving at their house, the Captain interrupts Mutch and Mrs Prout who are about to embrace. Upon meeting Mr Prout he soon finds him a cold man who verbally abuses his wife. The Trust is rounded out by the wandering Doctor McAdam and the chippy local Labour MP Joseph Byres.\n\nWith the help of his secretary, Private Jessie Killigrew, the Captain manages to organise the event. The hall is relatively well filled. Trying to avoid anything controversial, the Captain forbids any discussion of politics and begins with some innocuous questions about cows chasing after trains and if the Moon is inhabited? Things soon become heated when the MP takes offence at comments directed at him and threatens to start a fight. Having only just averted this, a question about marriage reveals the fragility of the Prouts' marriage. Fearing any controversy, the Captain quickly announces that it is time for the interval.\n\nAs word spreads around the camp of the goings-on, the second half begins with the room completely packed. The Captain tries to steer the debate back to harmless questions about bluebottles, but the audience demands an answer to the earlier question about marriage. As the Prouts begin arguing once again, Mrs Prout admits that the Professor is her lover. At this the whole event threatens to descend into anarchy despite the attempts of the Captain to maintain order. Desperate to restore a sense of propriety, he draws the proceedings to a close, and announces that next week they will return to classical music by inviting a string quartet. A soldier stands up and thanks the Captain for providing such entertainment and asking if the Brain Trust can be made a regular feature.\n\nWorried about Mr Prout, who has disappeared and has been drinking heavily, the others follow him back to his house where they mistakenly believe that he is going to throw himself over the cliffs. Instead, he is planning a bit of quiet painting. Meanwhile, the Professor has revealed himself to be an inherently selfish man, while Mr Prout is suddenly far more reasonable. He and Mrs Prout soon resolve their differences, and he tries to be a little more considerate to her.\n\nThe film ends with the string quartet playing once more and the Captain sitting almost entirely alone in the theatre.\n\nCast\n\n* Alastair Sim - Captain William Paris\n* Elizabeth Allan - Angela Prout\n* Roland Culver - George Prout\n* Colin Gordon - Professor James Mutch\n* Martita Hunt - Lady Dodds\n* Janet Brown - Jessie Killegrew\n* Peter Martyn - Walter\n* Miles Malleson - Doctor Hector McAdam\n* Edward Chapman - Joseph Byres MP\n* Cyril Chamberlain - Drill Sergeant\n* Michael Ripper - Drill Corporal\n* Robin Bailey - Intellectual Corporal\n* Michael Kelly - Staff Sergeant\n* George Cole - Soldier in audience\n* Maria Charles - WRAC Corp soldier\n* Martin Boddey - Brigadier\n\nProduction\n\nThe film was shot at Shepperton Studios and made by the British Lion Film Corporation. James Bridie wrote the screenplay, adapting it from his own play. Alastair Sim had previously produced the play in a 1944 run at the Westminster Theatre and was a driving force behind bringing it to the screen.  Launder was encouraged to make the film by Alexander Korda. \n\nReception\n\nA contemporary New York Times review described the film as a \"cheerful British import\". While noting that the film did not \"succeed in building into towering proportions the fragile theme of what makes a marriage tick\" the cast had made it \"all worth while\". The review praised the performance by Alastair Sim in particular. \n\nSim was nominated for a Best Actor BAFTA for his role as Captain Paris, but lost to Ralph Richardson for his performance in The Sound Barrier.\n", "context_len": 935, "questions": ["What is bliss when it is folly to be wise"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Fringillidae", "Carduelidae", "FINCH", "Carduelini", "Finches", "True finch", "Finch", "Finch (bird)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nPapal legate\nA woodcut showing Henry II of England greeting the pope's legate.\n\nA papal legate or Apostolic legate (from the Ancient Roman title legatus) is a personal representative of the pope to foreign nations, or to some part of the Catholic Church. He is empowered on matters of Catholic Faith and for the settlement of ecclesiastical matters.\n\nThe legate is appointed directly by the pope (the bishop of Rome, head of the Catholic Church and head of state of the papal states). Hence a legate is usually sent to a government, a sovereign or to a large body of believers (such as a national church) or to take charge of a major religious effort, such as an (ecumenical) council, a crusade to the Holy Land, or even against a heresy such as the Cathars.\n\nThe term legation is applied both to a legate's mandate and to the territory concerned (such as a state, or an ecclesiastical province). The relevant adjective is legatine.\n\nHistory \n\nCardinal Thomas Wolsey, papal legate to England during the reign of Henry VIII\nIn the High Middle Ages, papal legates were often used to strengthen the links between Rome and the many parts of Christendom. More often than not, legates were learned men and skilled diplomats who were not from the country they were accredited to. The Italian-born Guala Bicchieri served as papal legate to England in the early 13th century and played a major role in both the English government and church at the time. By the Late Middle Ages it had become more common to appoint native clerics to the position of legate within their own country, such as Cardinal Wolsey acting as legate to the court of Henry VIII of England. The reason for this switch in policy could be attributed to a change in attitude on the eve of The Reformation; by this point, foreign men representing the papacy would be more likely to reinforce dissent than bring Christendom closer together. \n\nPapal legates often summoned legatine councils, which dealt with church government and other ecclesiastical issues.  According to Pope Gregory VII, writing in the Dictatus papae, a papal legate \"presides over all bishops in a council, even if he is inferior in rank, and he can pronounce sentence of deposition against them\". During the Middle Ages, a legatine council was the usual means that a papal legate imposed his directives. \n\nDiplomatic Ranks \n\nThere are several ranks of papal legates in diplomacy, some of which are no longer used.\n\nApostolic nuncio\n\nCardinal Giovanni Francesco Commendone, sometime papal nuncio to Urbino, Ferrara, Venice, Parma, and England.\n\nThe most common form of papal legate today is the apostolic nuncio, whose task it is to strengthen relations between the Holy See and the Roman Catholic Church in a particular country and at the same time to act as the diplomatic representative of the Holy See to the government of that country.  An apostolic nuncio is generally equivalent in rank to that of ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary, although in Catholic countries the nuncio often ranks above ambassadors in diplomatic protocol. A nuncio performs the same functions as an ambassador and has the same diplomatic privileges. Under the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, to which the Holy See is a party, a nuncio is an ambassador like those from any other country. The Vienna Convention allows the host state to grant seniority of precedence to the nuncio over others of ambassadorial rank accredited to the same country, and may grant the deanship of that country's diplomatic corps to the nuncio regardless of seniority. \n\nPro-nuncio\n\nPro-nuncio was a term used from 1965 to 1991 for a papal diplomatic representative of full ambassadorial rank accredited to a country that did not accord him precedence over other ambassadors and de jure deanship of the diplomatic corps. In those countries, the papal representative's precedence within the corps is exactly on a par with that of the other members of ambassadorial rank, so that he becomes dean only on becoming the senior member of the corps. \n\nApostolic delegate\n\nFor countries with which the Holy See has no diplomatic relations, an apostolic delegate is sent to serve as a liaison with the Catholic Church in that country, though not accredited to its government.\n\nLegati\n\nLegatus a latere\n\nThis highest rank (literally \"from the (Pope's) side\", i.e. \"intimately\" trusted) is normally awarded to a priest of cardinal rank. It is an exceptional investiture and can either be focused or broad in scope. The legate a latere is the alter ego of the Pope, and as such, possesses full plenipotentiary powers. \n\nLegatus natus\n\nLiterally \"born legate\", i.e. not nominated individually but ex officio, namely a bishop holding this rank as a privilege of his see, e.g. archbishops of Canterbury (pre-Reformation), Prague, Esztergom, Udine, Salzburg, Poznan and Cologne. The legatus natus would act as the pope's representative in his province, with a legatus a latere only being sent in extraordinary circumstances. Although limited in their jurisdiction compared to legati a latere, a legatus natus were not subordinate to them. \n\nLegatus missus\n\nLiterally \"sent legate\", possessing limited powers for the purpose of completing a specific mission. This commission is normally focused in scope and of short duration.\n\nGubernatorial legates \n\nSome administrative (temporal) provinces of the Papal states in (mostly central) Italy were governed by a Papal Legate. This has been the case in Benevento, in Pontecorvo (of Campagna e Marittima/ of Frosinone) and in Viterbo.\nIn four cases, including Bologna, this post was awarded exclusively to Cardinals; the Velletri post was created for Bartolommeo cardinal Pacca.\n\nThe title could be changed to Apostolic Delegate, as happened in Frosinone (for Pontecorvo) in 1827.\n\nCitations\n", "context_len": 1079, "questions": ["What name is given to a Papal legate or ambassador to a civil government?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["K249DR", "KENT", "KAZZ (AM)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

Hosted by comedian Marcus Brigstocke, each episode features a celebrity guest trying out experiences that are new to them, but common to many others. The title comes from the show's producer and creator, Bill Dare, having never seen the Star Wars films.  The series has been the subject of controversy due to the questionable taste of some of the experiences.  \n\nThe show has been adapted for television and was first broadcast on BBC Four in early 2009. \n\nFormat\n\nEach episode features a guest presenting a list of things to Brigstocke that, until coming on the show, they had never done before but many others have. Generally the show is structured around one each of certain types of experiences; reading a new book, listening to some new music, watching a new film or television programme (for all of these, the guest is often given an example of a genre they've never sampled before), eating a new food and taking part in a new leisure activity. Examples of the latter include comedian Phill Jupitus having his first colonic irrigation, magician Paul Daniels learning how to swim and Goodies star Tim Brooke-Taylor buying his first pornographic magazine. \n\nReception\n\nThe series has a mixed reception. Critics have praised the format. Chris Campling said I've Never Seen Star Wars is, \"one of the most invigorating new comedy series of the 21st century.\" \n\nElisabeth Mahoney in The Guardian wrote about Jupitus' appearance saying: \"He also tried colonic irrigation, and the recording of that was one of the funniest bits of radio this year. The therapist explained the process in a deadpan manner that was quite majestic, especially when she let her \"tubing clamps\" make their worrying sound effect. Jupitus fretted that she'd find \"some hidden G-spot of delight\" and that he'd become \"sexually addicted to having my arse pumped out\". Rather worryingly, then, he has already booked his next appointment.\" \n\nHowever, the series has been attacked because of some of the experiences which have appeared. Jupitus' colonic irrigation and eating foie gras, and Brooke-Taylor buying pornography are amongst the moments which have been cause for complaint. Dare appeared on BBC Radio 4's listener complaints show Feedback to defend I've Never Seen Star Wars. Dare stated the choices were all made by the guests and were not designed to offend listeners. During the interview with host Roger Bolton, Dare was asked, \"if he could reassure listeners that there'd be no heavy breathing in future.\" Dare mocked  both Feedback and Bolton saying: \"Only if we get an asthmatic on, I suppose.

It is 1038 km long, 716 km in Spain, 47 km along the border between Portugal and Spain and 275 km in Portugal, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean near Lisbon.  It drains an area of 80100 sqkm (the second largest in the Iberian peninsula after the Douro).  The Tagus is highly utilized for most of its course. Several dams and diversions supply drinking water to most of central Spain, including Madrid, and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power. Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol it enters a vast alluvial valley prone to flooding. At its mouth is a large estuary on which the port city of Lisbon is situated.\n\nThe source of the Tagus is the Fuente de Garc\u00eda, in the Fr\u00edas de Albarrac\u00edn municipal term, Montes Universales, Sistema Ib\u00e9rico, Sierra de Albarrac\u00edn Comarca.

At Valdeverdeja is the upper end of the long upper reservoir, the Embalse de Valdeca\u00f1as, beyond which are the Embalse de Torrejon, into which flow the Ti\u00e9tar, and the lower reservoir, the Alc\u00e1ntara Dam into which flows the Alag\u00f3n at the lower end.\n\nThere is a canal and aqueduct between the Tagus and the Segura.\n\nIn Portugal\n\nAfter forming the border it enters Portugal, passing Vila Velha de R\u00f3d\u00e3o, Abrantes, Const\u00e2ncia, Entroncamento, Santar\u00e9m and Vila Franca de Xira at the head of the long narrow estuary, which has Lisbon at its mouth. The estuary is protected by the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve. There is the largest bridge across the river, the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which with a total length of  is the longest bridge in Europe.\n\nThe Portuguese Alentejo region and former Ribatejo Province take their names from the river; Alentejo, from al\u00e9m Tejo \"Beyond the Tagus\" and Ribatejo from arriba Tejo, an archaic way of saying \"Upper Tagus\".\n\nGeology\n\nThe lower Tagus is on a fault line. Slippage along it has caused numerous earthquakes, the major ones being those of 1309, 1531 and 1755. \n\nHistory\n\nThe Pepper Wreck, properly the wreck of the Nossa Senhora dos M\u00e1rtires, is a shipwreck located and excavated at the mouth of the Tagus between 1996 and 2001.\n\nThe river had strategic value to the Spanish and Portuguese empires, as it guarded the approach to Lisbon. For example, in 1587, Sir Francis Drake briefly approached the river after his successful raid at Cadiz. \n\nPopular culture\n\nA major river, the Tagus is brought to mind in the songs and stories of the Portuguese. A popular fado song in Lisbon notes that while people get older, the Tagus remains young (\"My hair getting white, the Tagus is always young\"). The author, Fernando Pessoa, wrote a poem that begins: \n\"The Tagus is more beautiful than the river that flows through my village. But the Tagus is not more beautiful than the river that flows through my village...\" \n\nRichard Crashaw's poem \"Saint Mary Magdalene, or the Weeper\" refers to the \"Golden\" Tagus as wanting Mary Magdalene's silver tears. In classical poetry the Tagus was famous for its gold-bearing sands (Catullus 29.19, Ovid, Amores, 1.15.34, Juvenal, Satires, 3.55, etc.).\n", "context_len": 723, "questions": ["Through which European capital city does the River Tagus flow?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["The Wanderer", "Wanderer (disambiguation)", "The Wanderer (album)", "Wanderer", "Wanderer (album)", "The Wanderer (song)", "Wanderers", "The Wanderer (disambiguation)", "WANDERERS", "The wanderers", "The Wanderers", "The Wanderer (novel)", "The Wanderers (novel)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nGland\nA gland is an organ in an animal's body that synthesizes substances (such as hormones) for release into the bloodstream (endocrine gland) or into cavities inside the body or its outer surface (exocrine gland).\n\nStructure\n\nDevelopment\n\nEvery gland is formed by an ingrowth from an epithelial surface. This ingrowth may in the beginning possess a tubular structure, but in other instances glands may start as a solid column of cells which subsequently becomes tubulated.\n\nAs growth proceeds, the column of cells may divide or give off offshoots, in which case a compound gland is formed. In many glands, the number of branches is limited, in others (salivary, pancreas) a very large structure is finally formed by repeated growth and sub-division. As a rule, the branches do not unite with one another, but in one instance, the liver, this does occur when a reticulated compound gland is produced. In compound glands the more typical or secretory epithelium is found forming the terminal portion of each branch, and the uniting portions form ducts and are lined with a less modified type of epithelial cell.\n\nGlands are classified according to their shape.\n* If the gland retains its shape as a tube throughout it is termed a tubular gland.\n* In the second main variety of gland the secretory portion is enlarged and the lumen variously increased in size. These are termed alveolar or saccular glands.\n\nFunction\n\nGlands are divided based on their function into two groups:\n\nEndocrine glands\n\nEndocrine glands secrete substances that circulate through the blood stream. These glands that secrete their products through the basal lamina into the blood stream and lack a duct system. These glands often secrete hormones, and play an important role in maintaining homeostasis. The pineal gland, thymus gland, pituitary gland, thyroid gland, and the two adrenal glands are all endocrine glands.\n\nExocrine glands\n \n\nExocrine glands secrete their products through a duct onto an outer surface of the body, such as the skin or the human gastrointestinal tract. Secretion is directly onto the apical surface. The glands in this group can be divided into three groups:\n* Apocrine glands a portion of the secreting cell's body is lost during secretion. Apocrine gland is often used to refer to the apocrine sweat glands, however it is thought that apocrine sweat glands may not be true apocrine glands as they may not use the apocrine method of secretion. e.g. mammery gland, sweat gland of arm pit, pubic region, skin around anus, lips, nipples.\n* Holocrine glands the entire cell disintegrates to secrete its substances (e.g., sebaceous glands)sebaceous, meibomiun & zeis gland.\n* Merocrine glands cells secrete their substances by exocytosis (e.g., mucous and serous glands). Also called \"eccrine\". e.g. max sweat gland of humans, goblet cells, salivary gland, tear gland, intestinal glands.\n\nThe type of secretory product of exocrine glands may also be one of three categories:\n* Serous glands secrete a watery, often protein-rich, fluid-like product, e.g. sweat glands.\n* Mucous glands secrete a viscous product, rich in carbohydrates (such as glycoproteins), e.g. goblet cells.\n* Sebaceous glands secrete a lipid product. These glands are also known as oil glands, e.g. Fordyce spots and meibomian glands.\n\nClinical significance\n\nOther animals\n\nAdditional images\n\n Image:Gray1025.png|Section of submaxillary gland of kitten.

{"context": "\nNames of Cambodia\nThe name of Cambodia in the Khmer language is \"Kampuchea\" (; Preah Reachanach\u00e2k Kampuchea), which derives from Sanskrit ' (\u0915\u092e\u094d\u092c\u094b\u091c\u0926\u0947\u0936; \"land of Kambuja\"). It is not unique to the modern kingdom of Cambodia: the same name (i.e. Kamboj/Kambuja) is also found in Burmese and Thai chronicles referring to regions within those kingdoms. In the Indian chronicles the Kambuja were a barbarian (in the sense of non-Indian) people in the area of modern Afghanistan. \"The application to Southeast Asia has no ethnic content and does not imply any migration of peoples from the original Kambuja; the most likely explanation is that, when Indian traders and Brahmins came into contact with local populations some two thousand years ago, they gave them the names of regions which, in their view, were similarly marginal and remote: the peoples of Southeast Asia, like the barbarian Kamboja, had no castes, did not observe proper food prohibitions and had different rules for marriage.\"  An origin-myth recorded in the Baksei Chamkrong inscription, dated AD 947, derives Kambuja from Svayambhuva Kamboj, a legendary Indian sage who reached the Indochina peninsula and married a naga princess named Mera, thus uniting the Indian and local races. In this story Kambuja derives from Kambu+ja, and means \"descendants of Kambu.\" \n\nPreah Reachanach\u00e2k Kampuchea means \"Kingdom of Cambodia\". Etymologically, its components are: Preah- (\"sacred\"); -reach- (\"king, royal, realm\", from Sanskrit); -ana- (from P\u0101li ', \"authority, command, power\"); -ch\u00e2k (from Sanskrit chakra, meaning \"wheel\", a symbol of power and rule).\n\nThe name used on formal occasions, such as political speeches and news programs, is Pr\u00e2teh Kampuchea (), literally \"the Country of Cambodia\". The colloquial name most used by Khmer people is Srok Khmae (), literally \"Khmer Land\".

{"context": "\nLudovico technique\nThe Ludovico technique is a fictional aversion therapy from the novel A Clockwork Orange administered by a \"Dr. Brodsky\" at the Ludovico medical facility, with the approval of the UK Minister of the Interior.  It involved forcing a patient to watch, through the use of specula to hold the eyes open, violent images for long periods, while under the effect of a nausea-, paralysis-, and fear-inducing drug. The aim of the therapy was to condition the patient to experience severe nausea when experiencing or even thinking about violence, thus creating an aversion to violent behaviour. \n\nThe therapy renders the protagonist of the novel, Alex, incapable of violence even in self-defense, and unable to touch a naked woman or think about having sexual intercourse.  In the original novel, Alex is accidentally conditioned against all classical music due to the background score of the films. In the 1971 film, he is conditioned only against Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. \"Ludovico\" is the Italian equivalent of the German name \"Ludwig\"; it is possible the name was selected for this reason.\n\nFilm critic Thomas Nelson has compared this brainwashing technique with the recruit training in Kubrick's later film Full Metal Jacket. He notes that the latter produces a contrasting effect when one of the recruits (Leonard Lawrence) becomes conditioned, during boot camp training, to become a violent killing machine who associates his sexuality with his rifle.  \n\nIn popular culture \n\nThe reference from A Clockwork Orange is shown in the Simpsons episode, \"Dog of Death\", when the family dog Santa's Little Helper runs away from home and is soon trained by Mr. Burns to become a vicious guard dog by being forced to watch a film featuring abuse to dogs while listening to Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.\n\nA second reference to the Ludovico technique in The Simpsons appears in the \"Treehouse of Horror XXV\" episode, where Moe's eyes are forced open with specula so he could watch Fox, part of a series of jokes about the Fox network. Yet another parodies Alex`s attempt to fondle a naked woman`s breasts after the treatment, where Bart reaches for two cupcakes, and proceeds to faint in the same manner as Alex in the season 4 episode, ``Duffless``.\n\nIn the \"Phineas and Ferb\" episode \"Phineas and Ferb Get Busted!\", the 2 namesake characters are shown experiencing the technique, this version forcing them to ignore their natural creativity. Their friend Baljeet is also seen going through this, but doesn't seem to care, as he is seen eating popcorn and claiming \"the book was so much better.\"\n\nIn the opening intro to Robot Chicken, the mad scientists uses this technique on the robotic chicken, forcing it to watch a wall of television sets showing various clips of the cartoon show.\n\nAnother reference was in the \"Family Guy\" episode \"Once Bitten\", Brian is seen experiencing this, showing things dogs would fear (including a picture of Michael Vick) to successfully force him into being more submissive.\n\nAnother reference from A Clockwork Orange is shown in the Archer episode, \"A Going Concern\" when Dr. Krieger, at Archer's request, uses a Modified Ludovico to brainwash Len Trexler as a measure to prevent Mallory from selling ISIS to ODIN.\n\nYet another reference exists in the video game The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth which contains an item called The Ludovico Technique and depicts Isaac as wearing a specula similar to the one used in the film adaptation of A Clockwork Orange. \n\nNotes\n", "context_len": 666, "questions": ["An aversion therapy called the 'Ludovico technique' from the 1971 classic A Clockwork Orange features which composer's music?

{"context": "\nSea snail\nSea snail is a common name for snails that normally live in saltwater, in other words marine gastropods. The taxonomic class Gastropoda also includes snails that live in other habitats, such as land snails and freshwater snails. Many species of sea snails are edible and exploited as food sources by humans.\n\nSea snails are marine gastropods with shells. Those marine gastropods with no shells, or only internal shells, are variously known by other common names, including sea slug, sea hare, nudibranch, etc. The diversity within sea snails is enormous. Many very different clades of gastropods are either dominated by, or consist exclusively of, sea snails. Because of this great variability, generalization about the feeding, reproduction, habitat, or other traits of sea snails is not possible. Instead, individual clades, families, genera, or species must be assessed.\n\nShells\n\nThe shells of most species of sea snails are spirally coiled. Some, though, have conical shells, and these are often referred to by the common name of limpets. In one unusual family (Juliidae), the shell of the snail has become two hinged plates closely resembling those of a bivalve; this family is sometimes called the \"bivalved gastropods\".\n\nTheir shells are found in a variety of shapes and sizes, but are normally very small. Those of living species of sea snails range in size from Syrinx aruanus, the largest living shelled gastropod species at 91\u00a0cm, to minute species whose shells are less than 1\u00a0mm at adult size. Because the shells of sea snails are strong and durable in many cases, as a group they are well represented in the fossil record.\n\nAnatomy\n\nSea snails are a very large group of animals and a very diverse one. Most snails that live in saltwater respire using a gill or gills, a few species, though, have a lung, are intertidal, and are active only at low tide when they can move around in the air. These air-breathing species include false limpets in the family Siphonariidae and another group of false limpets in the family Trimusculidae.\n\nMany, but not all sea snails have an operculum.\n\nHuman uses\n\nA number of species of sea snails are used by humans for food, including abalone, conch, limpets, whelks (such as the North American Busycon species and the North Atlantic Buccinum undatum) and periwinkles including Littorina littorea.\n\nThe shells of sea snails are often found by humans as seashells commonly wash up on beaches. Because the shells of many sea snails are attractive and durable, they have been used by humans to make necklaces and other jewelry from prehistoric times to the current day.\n\nThe shells of a few species of large sea snails within the Vetigastropoda have a thick layer of nacre and have been used as a source of mother of pearl. Historically, the button industry relied on these species for a number of years.\n\nUse by other animals\n\nThe shells of sea snails are used for protection by many kinds of hermit crabs. A hermit crab carries the shell by grasping the central columella of the shell using claspers on the tip of its abdomen.\n\nDefinition\n\nDetermining whether some gastropods should be called sea snails is not always easy. Some species that live in brackish water (such as certain neritids) can be listed as either freshwater snails or marine snails, and some species that live at or just above the high tide level (for example species in the genus Truncatella) are sometimes considered to be sea snails and sometimes listed as land snails.\n\nTaxonomy\n\n2005 taxonomy \n\nThe following cladogram is an overview of the main clades of living gastropods based on the taxonomy of Bouchet & Rocroi (2005),  with taxa that contain saltwater or brackish water species marked in boldface (some of the highlighted taxa consist entirely of marine species, but some of them also contain freshwater or land species.)\n\n* Clade Patellogastropoda\n* Clade Vetigastropoda\n* Clade Cocculiniformia\n* Clade Neritimorpha\n**Clade Cycloneritimorpha\n* Clade Caenogastropoda\n**Informal group Architaenioglossa\n**Clade Sorbeoconcha\n**Clade Hypsogastropoda\n***Clade Littorinimorpha\n***Informal group Ptenoglossa\n***Clade Neogastropoda\n*Clade Heterobranchia\n**Informal group Lower Heterobranchia\n**Informal group Opisthobranchia\n***Clade Cephalaspidea\n***Clade Thecosomata\n***Clade Gymnosomata\n***Clade Aplysiomorpha\n***Group Acochlidiacea\n***Clade Sacoglossa\n***Group Cylindrobullida\n***Clade Umbraculida\n***Clade Nudipleura\n****Clade Pleurobranchomorpha\n****Clade Nudibranchia\n*****Clade Euctenidiacea\n*****Clade Dexiarchia\n******Clade Pseudoeuctenidiacea\n******Clade Cladobranchia\n*******Clade Euarminida\n*******Clade Dendronotida\n*******Clade Aeolidida\n**Informal group Pulmonata\n***Informal group Basommatophora\n***Clade Eupulmonata\n****Clade Systellommatophora\n****Clade Stylommatophora\n*****Clade Elasmognatha\n*****Clade Orthurethra\n*****Informal group Sigmurethra\n", "context_len": 955, "questions": ["What is the edible sea snail of the genus Haliotis, which has an ear-shaped shell with a pearly interior?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["UN/LOCODE:ITFLR", "Folrenz", "Firenze, Italy", "\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05e0\u05e6\u05d4", "Montughi", "Firenze", "Gualfonda", "FLORENCE", "Florentine", "Frorence", "Florence (Italy)", "Florence", "Florence, Italy"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

It was directed by Mervyn LeRoy and produced by Arthur Hornblow Jr. from a screenplay by Everett Freeman. The music score was by Adolph Deutsch, the cinematography by George J. Folsey and the choreography by Busby Berkeley. \n\nGeorge J. Folsey received a 1953 Oscar nomination for  Best Cinematography, Color. \n\nThe film stars Esther Williams, Victor Mature, and Walter Pidgeon, with David Brian and Donna Corcoran.\n\nPlot\n\nIn the late 19th Century, a polio-stricken Australian girl, Annette Kellerman (Esther Williams), swims as a means to improve her health. Her father, Frederick (Walter Pidgeon), who owns a music conservatory, accepts a teaching position in England.\n\nAboard ship, Annette encounters the American promoter James Sullivan (Victor Mature) and his associate Doc Cronnol (Jesse White), who are taking a boxing kangaroo called Sydney with them to London.\n\nThe teaching position falls through and Jimmy suggests promoting Annette in a six-mile swim to Greenwich. She volunteers to make it 26 miles instead. Word spreads of the swim and Annette's feat makes news.\n\nJimmy suggests they can make a fortune by going to New York and appearing in a water ballet at the Hippodrome.   Manager Alfred Harper (David Brian) does not offer them a job in the show, so Annette goes to Boston for a highly publicized swim and gets in hot water for wearing a one-piece suit too revealing for its time.\n\nShe and Jimmy have a misunderstanding and part ways. Harper has a change of heart and makes Annette headliner of his New York show. After the death of her father, she travels to Montauk at the behest of Doc to try to dissuade Jimmy from flying in an air race with a $50,000 prize. It does not go well.\n\nAs time passes, Harper falls in love with Annette while she travels to Hollywood to make a film. Jimmy and Doc turn up, this time promoting a dog called Rin Tin Tin that they hope to star in the movies.\n\nA water tank bursts during the making of Annette's film, causing her serious injury, Spinal Hematoma. With her future in doubt, Harper steps aside when he sees for himself how much Annette and Jimmy are in love.\n\nCast \n\n* Esther Williams as Annette Kellerman \n* Victor Mature as James Sullivan \n* Walter Pidgeon as Frederick Kellerman \n* David Brian as Alfred Harper \n* Donna Corcoran as Annette Kellerman at age 10 \n* Jesse White as Doc Cronnol \n* Maria Tallchief as Pavlova \n* Howard Freeman as Aldrich, Lecture Bureau \n* Charles Watts as Policeman on Revere Beach \n* Wilton Graff as Garvey the Producer \n* Frank Ferguson as Boston Prosecutor \n* James Bell as Boston Judge \n* James Flavin as Train conductor \n* Willis Bouchey as Movie director\n\nProduction\n\nMGM signed a deal with Kellerman to make a film based on her life in 1951. It was originally called The One Piece Suit. \n\nKellerman thought Williams was \"too beautiful\" to play her and thought Victor Mature's depiction of Jimmy Sullivan was \"the antithesis\" of the character in real life (\"he never did anything cheap\"). \n\nThe title\n\nMillion Dollar Mermaid not only became Esther Williams' nickname around Hollywood, but it became the title of her autobiography (New York: Simon and Schuster, 1999), co-written with Digby Diehl. Williams has often called this her favorite film. \n\nRelease\n\nAccording to MGM records the film earned $2,851,000 in the US and Canada and $2,096,000 elsewhere resulting in a profit of $243,000.\n\nHome media\n\nOn October 6, 2009, Turner Entertainment released Million Dollar Mermaid on DVD as part of the Esther Williams Spotlight Collection, Volume 2.

{"context": "\nRoss Kemp\nRoss James Kemp (born 21 July 1964) is an English actor, author and BAFTA award-winning investigative journalist who rose to prominence in the role of Grant Mitchell in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Since 2006, Kemp has received international recognition as an investigative journalist for his critically acclaimed and award-winning documentary series.\n\nActing career\n\nEarly career\n\nAfter training at Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art, Kemp received his Equity card when appearing alongside John Thaw and Richard Wilson at the Palace Theatre, Westcliff-on-Sea. He went on to feature in training films for the Ministry of Defence and the ITV soap opera Emmerdale Farm (now Emmerdale) as Graham Lodsworth. Guest appearances in London's Burning and Birds of a Feather followed, before getting a minor role in the 1987 film Playing Away alongside Neil Morrissey. \n\nEastEnders\n\nKemp's best-known role to date is that of hardman Grant Mitchell in the BBC soap opera EastEnders. Making his debut in February 1990, his character was often at the centre of major storylines, including abusive marriages to Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean) and Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon), as well as the \"Sharongate\" storyline, which saw brother Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) having an affair with Grant's wife.\n\nKemp announced in April 1999 that he would be leaving the soap later that year after nearly a decade. His exit was aired in October 1999 when his character moved to Brazil after surviving a car crash. Kemp refused to rule out an eventual return to EastEnders, and various media reports over the next few years speculated that he would be returning to the series at some stage. In early 2005, the BBC confirmed that Kemp would be returning to EastEnders later that year after six years away. It was co-star Barbara Windsor who convinced him to go back for a brief period.  His first comeback lasted just a few weeks from the late autumn of 2005, but he returned for a period of three months in 2006, before departing once again in June that year. Kemp has won various awards for his portrayal of Grant. \n\nIn January 2016 it was confirmed that Kemp would make a brief return to the show for the death of Grant's on-screen mother, Peggy Mitchell (Barbara Windsor), appearing in three episodes from 13 to 17 May.   Followed by an unannounced appearance on 4 July 2016 and later filmed a further three weeks which will air in late August.\n\nOther roles\n\nFollowing his initial departure from EastEnders, Kemp moved from the BBC to ITV for a reported \u00a31.2\u00a0million two-year deal.  Kemp's first role for ITV was in Hero of the Hour. During its filming, on 27 October 1999, Kemp required hospital treatment after being shot in the face when a stunt went wrong. He suffered cuts to his chest and face after safety glass shattered, and was also hit in the face by the discharge from a blank round. He was treated at the scene by paramedics, but made a full recovery.\n\nHe also starred as the lead in ITV's Christmas edition of A Christmas Carol. He took the lead roles in the television series, Without Motive and In Defence in 2000, and in 2002's Ultimate Force, where he took the role of Army Staff sergeant Henry Garvie from the British Special Air Service. He continued to appear in this role until 2006. He also gained the role of \"Cirra\" in the 2004 TV film, Spartacus.\n\nIn 2005, Kemp appeared in an episode of BBC's Extras and in a two-part adaptation of the Gerald Seymour novel A Line in the Sand for ITV, and he has also presented, on The Friday Night Project and appeared as a stand in host on The Paul O'Grady Show (2007; 2008).\n\nKemp appeared in the 4th episode of Series 14 of BBC's motoring show Top Gear. He was the \"Man in Boot\" of a Renault Twingo Sport being tested by Jeremy Clarkson. The test ended with Clarkson driving the car off the quayside of Belfast Harbour, after which Clarkson joked that Kemp was killed. \n\nWriting\n\nKemp has written several books. Initially focusing on tie-ins to his various TV documentaries, 2011 saw the publication of his first fictional story, Devil to Pay. A novel, Moving Target, was released in summer 2012.\n\nPolitics\n\nIn 1999 Kemp was elected as Rector of the University of Glasgow as the candidate of the Glasgow University Labour Club, but resigned in 2000 after the Glasgow University Students' Representative Council passed a motion requesting him to do so.  Kemp was succeeded by Greg Hemphill. \n\nIn August 2014, Kemp was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to The Guardian opposing Scottish independence in the run-up to September's referendum on that issue. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHis mother Jean was a hairdresser and his father John was a Detective Chief Inspector in the police force. He has one brother, Darren, who is a filmmaker for the BBC. He attended Shenfield High School and the Webber Douglas Academy. \n\nOn 11 June 2002 Kemp married Rebekah Wade, the then editor of The Sun. In November 2005 Wade was arrested following an alleged assault on her husband.  Kemp refused medical attention for a swollen lip and no action was taken.  In March 2009 Kemp and Wade divorced, and in October 2010, Kemp became a father to a baby boy by ex-partner Nicola Coleman who was his makeup artist. \n\nRoss Kemp married Renee O'Brien in 2012.  On 9 April 2015, Kemp announced via Twitter that he had become a father for the second time to a baby boy. \n\nAwards\n\nFilmography\n\nTV\n\nFilms\n", "context_len": 1051, "questions": ["Ross Kemp plays which Eastenders character?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Newbury", "Newbury (disambiguation)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nThe Stranger Beside Me\nThe Stranger Beside Me is a 1980 autobiographical and biographical true crime book written by Ann Rule about the serial killer Ted Bundy, whom she knew personally before and after his arrest for a series of murders.  Subsequent revisions of the book were published in 1986, 1989, 2000, and 2008.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe first few chapters following the brief introduction about Bundy's birth and family describe Rule's friendship with Bundy, her first impressions of him, and her reluctance to consider the evidence that he might be responsible for the crimes of which he was accused.\n\nThe events of the Chi Omega murders at Florida State University in January 1978 are written in third person, but not omnisciently, as the perpetrator is not identified as being Bundy, thus keeping the documentation of these events in-sync with the knowledge available to officers at the time.\n\nIt is not until Bundy's capture and trials in Florida that Rule fully accepts that Bundy is a serial killer. She finds the idea shocking to the point that she \"[runs] to the ladies room and throws up.\"  An afterword, following Rule's lament for Bundy and his victims, describes the Kimberly Leach trial. The 1989 update outlines Bundy's execution, and the 2000 update touches on many things, including various women claiming to have encountered Bundy in the 1970s, Robert Keppel's retirement from detective work and his employment at the University of Washington, and Bundy's possible involvement in the unsolved disappearance of Ann Marie Burr, a girl who disappeared in 1961 when Bundy was 14. \n\nA 2008 update of the book includes more stories from women who have contacted Rule with stories of their \"near-miss\" contacts with a man they believe was Ted Bundy, and also a \"Ted Bundy FAQ\" section in which Rule tries to answer the questions most frequently asked by readers, including the fact that he was not responsible for the 1973 murder of Kathy Merry Devine, for which he was long suspected. DNA testing linked that killing to an ex-convict named William Cosden, who was subsequently tried and convicted of her murder.\n\nFilm adaptation\n\nIn 2003, The Stranger Beside Me was adapted into a made-for-TV film, starring Billy Campbell as Bundy and Barbara Hershey as Rule.\n", "context_len": 424, "questions": ["Ann Rules book The Stranger Beside Me, is about what serial killer, assumed to have murdered 35 people, before hitting the electric chair in Starke, Florida on January 24, 1989?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Smert' Shpionam", "SMERSH", "\u0421\u041c\u0415\u0420\u0428", "Smersh", "NKVD Special Section"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nStudies on Hysteria\nStudies on Hysteria () is an 1895 book by Sigmund Freud and Josef Breuer. It consists of a joint introductory paper (reprinted from 1893); followed by five individual studies of \"hysterics\" \u2013 Breuer's famous case of Anna O. (real name: Bertha Pappenheim), seminal for the development of psychoanalysis, and four more by Freud; and finishing with a theoretical essay by Breuer and a more practice-oriented one on therapy by Freud. \n\nSummary\n\nFreud sees symptomology as stratified in an almost geological way, with the outermost strata being easily remembered and accepted, while \u201cthe deeper one goes the more difficult it is to recognise the recollections that are surfacing\u201d. \n\nReception and influence\n\nBreuer's work with Bertha Pappenheim provided the founding impetus for psychoanalysis, as Freud himself would acknowledge.  In their preliminary (1893) paper, both men agreed that \u201cthe hysteric suffers mainly from reminiscences\u201d.  Freud however would come to lay more stress on the causative role of sexuality in producing hysteria, as well as gradually repudiating Breuer's use of hypnosis as a means of treatment.  Some of the theoretical scaffolding of the Studies \u2013 \"strangulated affect\", hypnoid state  \u2013 would be abandoned with the crystallisation of psychoanalysis as an independent technique.  However, many of Freud\u2019s clinical observations \u2013 on mnenmic symbols  or deferred action  for example \u2013 would continue to be confirmed in his later work. At the same time, Breuer\u2019s theoretical essay, with its examination of the principle of constancy, and its differentiation of bound and mobile cathexis,  would continue to inform Freud\u2019s thinking as late as the twenties and the writing of Beyond the Pleasure Principle.\n\nAt the time of its release, Studies on Hysteria tended to polarise opinion, both within and outside by the medical community.  While many were critical, Havelock Ellis offered an appreciative account, while a leading Viennese paper would characterise the work as \u201cthe kind of psychology used by poets\u201d.  Studies on Hysteria received a positive review from psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler, although Bleuler nevertheless suggested that the results Freud and Breuer reported could have been the result of suggestion. Philosopher Mikkel Borch-Jacobsen and psychologist Sonu Shamdasani comment that Studies on Hysteria gave Freud, \"a certain local and international notoriety\". Borch-Jacobsen and Shamdasani write that, contrary to what Freud and Breuer claimed, Freud \"always knew that the treatment of Bertha Pappenheim...had not been an unmitigated success\".\n", "context_len": 462, "questions": ["\"Who wrote the book \"\"Studies in Hysteria\"\" and \"\"Interpretation of Dreams\"\"?\""], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Midtribulation rapture", "Midtribulationism", "Pre-tribulation", "Pre-tribulation rapture", "Rapture", "Pretribulation rapture", "Mid-tribulation rapture", "Rapture (Protestant belief)", "The Teaching of the rapture", "Pretribulationistism", "Pre Tribulation", "Pre-tribulational", "Pre-trib"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nPresident of the Confederate States of America\nThe President of the Confederate States of America was the elected head of state and government of the Confederate States. The president also headed the executive branch of government and was commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into Confederate service. \n\nArticle II of the Confederate States Constitution vested the executive power of the Confederacy in the president. The power included the execution of law, alongside the responsibility of appointing executive, diplomatic, regulatory and judicial officers, and concluding treaties with foreign powers with the advice and consent of the senate. He was further empowered to grant reprieves and pardons, and convene and adjourn either or both houses of congress under extraordinary circumstances.\n\nThe president was indirectly elected by the people through the Electoral College to a six-year term, and was one of only two nationally elected Confederate officers, the other being the Vice President of the Confederate States. On February 18, 1861, Jefferson Davis became president of the provisional government. On February 22, 1862, he was elected president of the permanent government and served in that capacity until being captured by elements of the United States Cavalry in 1865. \n\nPowers and duties\n\nThe constitutional powers of the President of the Confederate States of America were quite similar to those of the President of the United States of America. The permanent Confederate States Constitution made him commander-in-chief of the Army and Navy, and of the militia of the several states when called into service of the Confederate States. He was also empowered to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the Confederate States. He was authorized to make treaties; to nominate and appoint diplomatic representatives, judges, and other officers of the Confederate States (including the heads of the executive departments) by and with the consent of the Confederate States Senate; and to remove such representatives and officers. He could fill vacancies during a recess of the Senate, but he could not reappoint, during a recess, persons previously rejected by it. He was to supply Congress with information, recommend legislation, receive ambassadors and other public ministers, see that the federal laws were faithfully executed, and commission all officers of the military and naval forces of the Confederate States.\n\nElection and oath\n\nOn February 9, 1861, the provisional congress at Montgomery elected Jefferson Davis president and Alexander H. Stephens vice president. Stephens, who was a delegate to Congress from Georgia, was inaugurated on February 11. Davis was inaugurated on February 18 upon his arrival from Mississippi, where he had gone upon his resignation from the U.S. Senate. Davis and Stephens were elected on November 6, 1861, for six-years terms, as provided by the permanent constitution. The Capital had been moved in June 1861, to Richmond, and the inauguration took place at the statue of Washington, on the public square, on February 22, 1862.\n\nBefore Davis entered on the execution of his office as President of the Confederate States, he was constitutionally required to take the following oath or affirmation:\n\nCompensation\n\nIn 1861, the President of the Confederate States earned a $25,000 annual salary, along with an expense account, and a nontaxable travel account.  The President's Office was located on the second floor of the Custom House on Main Street, a structure which also housed the Cabinet Room and the State and Treasury Department. The City of Richmond purchased the Brockenbrough house for presentation to the Confederate government for use as an executive mansion. Davis declined to accept the gift, but the mansion was leased for his use. Referred to as the \"White House of the Confederacy\" or the \"Grey House,\" the mansion was used by President Davis throughout the existence of his presidency. Later it became a repository for documents, relics, and pictures, and in 1896 it was redesignated the Confederate Museum.\n\nPost-presidency\n\nLate on the evening of April 2, 1865, President Davis, his aides, and members of the Cabinet, except Secretary of War Breckinridge, departed from Richmond on the Richmond and Danville Railroad. The Cabinet stayed at Danville, 140 mi miles southwest of Richmond, until April 10, when, hearing of Lee's surrender, it continued farther south. At Greensboro, North Carolina, on April 12 the Cabinet met with Generals Johnston and Beauregard and discussed surrender of Johnston's army to General Sherman. As the railroad south of Greensboro had been destroyed, the flight from that location was on horseback and in ambulances, wagons, and carriages. The last Cabinet meetings took place at Charlotte, on April 24, and 26, and on May 4; when Davis left Washington, Georgia, the party consisted only of his aides and Postmaster General Reagan. Elements of the United States Cavalry captured Davis and his companions at an encampment near Irwinville, May 10, 1865.\n\nJefferson Davis was imprisoned at Fort Monroe, Virginia, until his release on bail on May 13, 1867. During his confinement the United States Government prepared to bring him to trial for treason and for complicity in the assassination of United States President Abraham Lincoln. He could not be tried in Virginia until the Federal court was reestablished there, but by the time the circuit judges were prepared in May 1867 the United States Government decided the outcome of a trial before a local jury was far too uncertain and dropped the proceedings. In November 1868 Davis was brought to trial under a new indictment, but the judges disagreed and the case was referred to the Supreme Court. President Johnson issued a general amnesty in December 1868, and the Supreme Court entered a nolle prosequi, thus freeing Davis.\n", "context_len": 1061, "questions": ["Who was president of the Confederate States during the American Civil War?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Chinese People's Republic", "China (Peking)", "The prc", "Socialist China", "Chinese PR", "PRoC", "PRC", "China's", "P.

On the North Shore toddlers ride this trail on a tricycle. John Gibson photo.\nThe IMBA Trail Difficulty Rating System is a basic method used to categorize the relative technical difficulty of recreation trails. The IMBA Trail Difficulty Rating System can:\nHelp trail users make informed decisions\nEncourage visitors to use trails that match their skill level\nManage risk and minimize injuries\nImprove the outdoor experience for a wide variety of visitors\nAid in the planning of trails and trail systems\nThis system was adapted from the International Trail Marking System used at ski areas throughout the world. Many trail networks use this type of system, most notably resort-based mountain biking trail networks. The system best applies to mountain bikers, but is also applicable to other visitors such as hikers and equestrians. These criteria should be combined with personal judgment and trail-user input to reach the final rating.\nTrail Rating Guidelines\n1. Rate Technical Challenge Only.\nThe system focuses on rating the technical challenge of trails, not the physical exertion. It is not practical to rate both types of difficulty with one system. Consider, for example, a smooth, wide trail that is 20 miles long. The technical challenge of this trail is easy, yet the distance would make the physical exertion difficult. The solution is to independently rate technical challenge, and indicate physical exertion by posting trail length, and possibly even elevation change.\n2. Collect Trail Measurements.\nUse the accompanying table and collect trail measurements for each criteria. There is no prescribed method for tallying a \"score\" for each trail. Evaluate the trail against the table and combine with judgment to reach the final rating. It is unlikely that any particular trail will measure at the same difficulty level for every criteria. For example, a certain trail may rate as a green circle in three criteria, but a blue square in two different criteria.\n3. Include Difficulty and Trail Length on Signs and Maps.\nTrail length is not a criterion of the system. Instead, trail length should be posted on signs in addition to the difficulty symbol. A sign displaying both length and difficulty provides lots of information, yet it is simple to create and easy to understand.\nLikewise, elevation change is not a criterion. The amount of climbing on a trail is more an indicator of physical exertion than technical difficulty. Mountainous regions may consider including the amount of climbing on trail signs.\n4. Evaluate Difficulty Relative to Local Trails.\nTrails should be rated relative to other trails in the region. Don't evaluate each trail in isolation. Consider all the trails in a region and how they compare to one another. This will help you rank the relative difficulty of each trail and will help trail users select an appropriate route. Trails will rate differently from region to region. A black diamond trail in one region may rate as a blue square in another region, but the ratings should be consistent locally.\n5. Use Good Judgment.\nRating a trail is not 100 percent objective. Its best to combine tangible data with subjective judgment to reach the final rating. For example, a trail may have a wide range of tread surfaces - most of the trail is easy, but some sections are more difficult. How would you rate it? Use your personal experience to consider all elements and select a rating that best matches the style of trail.\n6. Consider Other Trail Qualities.\nDon't forget to consider trail qualities beyond the objective criteria. A wide variety of features could contribute to a trail's difficulty. For example, exposure - the feeling of empty space next to and below the trail tread - provides an added psychological challenge beyond the steepness or roughness of the trail. A 3-inch rock seems like a boulder when a 50-foot drop looms on your side! Other qualities to think about are corridor clearance and turn radius.\n7. Use Common Sense and Seek Input.\nNo rating system can be totally objective or valid for every situation. This system is a tool to be combined with common sense. Look at trails with a discerning eye, and seek input from trail users before selecting the rating. Remember, a diverse trail network with a variety of trail styles is a great way to ensure happy visitors. Provide both easy and difficult trails to spread visitors and meet a range of needs. By indicating the length and difficulty of trails with a clear signage system, visitors will be able to locate their preferred type of trail easily.\nCriteria to Consider\n", "context_len": 897, "questions": ["In skiing, what colour diamond denotes an expert trail on signs and trail maps?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Budimpe\u0161ta", "Budapest", "Veres P\u00e9ter Gimn\u00e1zium", "Budape\u0161\u0165", "Judapest", "Transport in Budapest", "Budapesth", "Uj-Pest", "Buda-Pest", "Buda-Pesth", "Budape\u0161t", "Boedapest", "Capital of Hungary", "Nepsziget", "City of Budapest", "Budapest (Hungary)", "N\u00e9psziget", "Buda-pesth", "UN/LOCODE:HUBUD", "Budapest, Hungary"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nHibernia\nHibernia is the Classical Latin name for the island of Ireland. The name Hibernia was taken from Greek geographical accounts.  During his exploration of northwest Europe (c. 320 BC), Pytheas of Massilia called the island I\u00e9rn\u0113 (written ).  In his book Geographia (c. 150 AD), Claudius Ptolemaeus (\"Ptolemy\") called the island Iouern\u00ed\u0101 (written , where \"\u03bf\u03c5\"-ou stands for w).\nThe Roman historian Tacitus, in his book Agricola (c. 98 AD), uses the name Hibernia.  The Romans also sometimes used Scotia, \"land of the Scoti\", as a geographical term for Ireland in general, as well as just the part inhabited by those people.\n\n\u0399\u03bf\u03c5\u03ad\u03c1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1 Iouern\u00ed\u0101 was a Greek rendering of the Q-Celtic name *\u012aweri\u016b from which eventually arose the Irish names \u00c9riu and \u00c9ire. The original meaning of the name is thought to be \"abundant land\". \n\nPost-Roman usage\n\nThe High King Brian Boru (c. 941\u20131014) based his title on being emperor of the Irish people, which was in Latin: \"Imperator Scottorum\", as distinct from claiming to be Emperor of the island of Ireland. From 1172 the Lordship of Ireland gave the King of England the additional title \"Dominus Hibernie\" (sic, for Hiberniae; also \"Dominus Hybernie\"), Lord of Ireland. The Kingdom of Ireland created the title Rex Hiberniae, King of Ireland, for use in Latin texts. Gerard Mercator called Ireland \"Hybernia\" on his [http://www.teachnet.ie/dhorgan/2006/firstmaps.html world map of 1541]. In 1642 the motto of the Irish Confederates, a Catholic-landlord administration that ruled much of Ireland until 1650 was: Pro Deo, Rege et Patria, Hibernia Unanimis. (In English: For God, King and Fatherland, Ireland is United).\n\nHowever, unlike many Roman geographical names, the Latin \"Hibernia\" did not become the basis for the name for Ireland in any modern languages, with even Italian using Irlanda.  Apart from the Celtic languages all modern languages use a local variant of the English \"Ireland\". This is presumably because direct medieval contacts between Ireland and continental Europe were at too low a level to embed use of the Hibernian root, or the original Irish \u00c9ire, in local vernaculars.  This contrasts with Wales, which is still \"Pays de Galles\" in French, with similar terms in other Romance languages.\n\nBy the classicising 18th century the use of Hibernia had revived in some contexts, just as had the use of Caledonia, one of the Latin terms for Scotland, and Britannia for Britain.  \"Hibernia\" was used on Irish coins and companies such as the Hibernian Insurance Company were established (later renamed the Hibernian Group). The name took on popularity with the success of the Irish Patriot Party. At a time when Palladian classical architecture and design were being adopted in northern Europe, Hibernia was a useful word to describe Ireland with overtones of classical style and civility, particularly by the prosperous Anglo-Irish Ascendancy who were taught Latin at school. \"Hibernian\" was used as a term for people, and a general adjective. The Royal Exchange in Dublin was built in 1769\u201379 with the carved inscription \"SPQH\" for Senatus PopulusQue Hibernicus \u2013 The senate and people of Ireland.  The Royal Hibernian Academy dates from 1823.\n\nHibernia is a word that is rarely used today with regard to Ireland, except in long-established names.  It is occasionally used for names of organisations and various other things; for instance: Hibernia National Bank, Hibernian Insurance Group, Ancient Order of Hibernians, The Hibernian magazine, Hibernia College, Hibernian Football Club, HMS Hibernia, and modern derivatives, from Latin like Respublica Hibernica (Irish Republic) and Universitas Hiberniae Nationalis (National University of Ireland).  In Canada, Hibernia lends its name to the Hibernia oil field off Newfoundland, and to a large sea oil platform there, the Hibernia.\n\nAnother occurrence is in familial Hibernian fever or TRAPS (tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated periodic syndrome), a periodic fever first described in 1982 in a family of Irish and Scottish descent, but found in all ethnic groups. \n\nThe compound form Hiberno- remains more common, as in Hiberno-Norse, Hiberno-English, Hiberno-Scottish, Hibernophile, etc.\n\nAn Edinburgh team playing in the SPFL have adopted the name.\n", "context_len": 810, "questions": ["What country had the Roman name Hibernia?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Lady Browning", "Daphne Du Maurier", "Daphne de Maurier", "Daphne du Maurier", "Du Maurier, Daphne", "Dame Daphne du Maurier", "Daphne du maurier", "DAPHNE DU MAURIER", "Daphne Dumaurier", "Dame Daphne Du Maurier", "Dame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning DBE", "Dame Daphne du Maurier, Lady Browning"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

One day for New Year's Day, except two if it falls on Thursday (except leap years).\n2.

{"context": "\nInternational Skating Union\nThe International Skating Union (ISU) is the international governing body for competitive ice skating disciplines, including figure skating, synchronized skating, speed skating, and short track speed skating.  It was founded in Scheveningen, Netherlands, in 1892, making it one of the oldest international sport federations. The ISU was formed to establish standardized international rules and regulations for the skating disciplines it governs, and to organize international competitions in these disciplines. It is now based in Lausanne, Switzerland.\n\nHistory\n\nThe International Skating Union (ISU) was founded in 1892 to govern speed skating and figure skating.\n  In 1895, the ISU streamlined its mission to deal only with amateur competitors and not professionals.  The organization hosted its first amateur skating championship in February 1896 in St. Petersburg, Russia. \n\nThe United States and Canada formed a competing organization, the International Skating Union of America (ISUA), in 1907.   Within the next two\u00a0years, twelve European nations had joined the ISU, and the ISUA had only its original members. The ISUA folded in 1927. \n\nEuropean and North American figure skaters rarely competed against each other due to differences in their styles of skating.  The ISU had \"systematized and arranged\" the sport of figure skating, with competitions including  \"a selection of ten or twelve numbers from the I. S. U. programme, ... five minutes' free skating to music, ... [and] special figures\" on one foot.  In 1911, Canada joined the ISU, leaving the United States as the only major competitor to not be a member.\n\nShort track speed skating gained its own world championship event, hosted by the ISU, in 1976.  At the time, the sport was known as indoor speed skating, but it was renamed short-track when indoor rinks for the longer speed skating events were introduced.\n\nBy 1988, 38\u00a0nations had joined the ISU.  Within the next few years, the ISU abandoned one of its long-held practices, eliminating the use of mandatory figures in the singles' figure skating competitions and reducing their use in ice dancing. \n\nAfter the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, Utah, the ISU implemented sweeping changes to many of its events.  In one of the short track speed skating events, Apolo Anton Ohno was awarded the gold medal after the disqualification of Kim Dong-Sung.  Although the South Korean delegation protested the disqualification, ISU rules did not allow for a review of the official's call.  Several months later, the ISU approved the use of video replay, when available, to review referee decisions.   The rules for judging figure skating were also changed as the result of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games figure skating scandal.  According to Ottavio Cinquanta, president of the ISU, \"'Something was wrong there,' ...  'Not just the individual but also the system. It existed for 70 years. Now we are trying to replace one system with another.'\"  A new figure skating judging system took effect in 2004, eliminating the 6.0 system perfect scores and instead giving points for various technical elements. \n\nISU Championships\n\nIn addition to sanctioning other international competitions, the ISU designates the following competitions each year as \"ISU Championships\":\n\nSpeed skating:\n* Long track:\n** World Allround Speed Skating Championships\n** World Single Distances Speed Skating Championships (held only in non-Olympic years)\n** World Sprint Speed Skating Championships\n** World Junior Speed Skating Championships\n** European Speed Skating Championships\n* Short track:\n** World Short Track Speed Skating Championships\n** World Short Track Speed Skating Team Championships\n** World Junior Short Track Speed Skating Championships\n** European Short Track Speed Skating Championships\n* Figure skating:\n** World Figure Skating Championships\n** World Junior Figure Skating Championships\n** World Synchronized Skating Championships\n** World Junior Synchronized Skating Championships\n** European Figure Skating Championships\n** Four Continents Figure Skating Championships\n\nNote that events such as the Olympic Winter Games and the ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating are not ISU Championships. However, they do count towards Personal Best scores.\n\nFirst world championships\n\nDates and locations of first world championships in various disciplines held under the auspices of the ISU:\n* 1893: Speed skating (men only), Amsterdam\n* 1896: Figure skating (men only), St. Petersburg\n* 1906: Figure skating (ladies), Davos\n* 1908: Figure skating (pairs), St. Petersburg\n* 1936: Speed skating (women), Stockholm\n* 1952: Figure skating (ice dance), Paris\n* 1970: Sprint speed skating, West Allis, Wisconsin\n* 1978: Short track speed skating, Solihull, UK\n* 2000: Synchronized skating, Minneapolis\n\nCooperation with other sports\n\nISU has an agreement with Federation of International Bandy to use the same arenas. According to news published at bandynet.ru 7/6  bandy might be on the Olympic programme at Sochi 2014 as a branch of skating because ISU in 2007 got the right to within 3 years add another discipline.\n\nOrganization\n\nAs of the summer of 2008, the ISU consisted of 63 member nations, with a governing council of 11.  To add any proposal to the agenda of meetings, it must have support from four-fifths of the members.  Proposals on the agenda are approved with a two-thirds majority vote.\n\nPresidents of the ISU \n\n* 1892\u20131895 Pim Mulier\n* 1895\u20131925 Viktor Balck\n* 1925\u20131937 Ulrich Salchow\n* 1937\u20131945 Gerrit W.

{"context": "\nMeltemi wind - Greek Meltemi winds Turkey Greece ...\nMeltemi wind - Greek Meltemi winds Turkey Greece - Yachting and Sailing vacations the Aegean.\nThe Meltemi in Greece & Turkey\nThe Meltemi wind was known by the old Greeks as the Etesian\nnorthern winds, and results from a high pressure system\n(>1025)\nlaying over the Balkan/Hungary area and a relatively low pressure\n(<1010)\nsystem over Turkey .\nAlthough this katabatic wind\ncan bring about harsh sailing conditions it also provides cooling, low humidity and good visibility. Furthermore, it can be characterized as one of the few Mediterranean winds that do not necessarily die out at the end of the day and can easily last more than three to six days. See my climate page for Greek weather statistics.\nThe onset is the monsoonal\neffect of the summer season that leads to the development of an   intense heat trough over southern Asia extending westward over the Anatolian plateau. Higher pressure dominates over the relatively cooler surface of the   Mediterranean Sea, and settled, dry weather persists.    Northerly winds prevail along the Greek coast during the   winter also, but only those northerly winds occurring between May and   November are considered Etesian. The pressure gradients necessary to drive the   Meltemi result from a combination of:\nThe monsoonal effect during the summer that leads to a low pressure      trough over Turkey. Etesian winds flow from a high pressure ridge over     the Balkans toward the trough. During a strong Etesian, the trough may     extend relatively far to the west and beyond Rhodes . It may also form     a closed low, resulting in almost calm winds at Rhodes.\nSynoptic conditions leading to anti-cyclogenesis\nover the Balkans.\nA jet-effect increase of wind caused by channelling of the wind between      islands and mountain valleys. These effects tend to render wind reports     from certain locations unrepresentative. In the lee of Crete, katabatic     flow off the mountains generates gusty winds similar to the F\u00f6hn\nof the     Alps. The mountain valleys tend to channel the flow which increases the     wind velocity.\nThe surface flow is generally divergent in an Etesian situation, and    the weather is generally thought to be dry with clear skies. However,    this is mostly true only during the main yacht charter season of July and August    when scattered altocumulus appear a day before an Etesian, and the only other clouds are orographic\ntypes that may form on the lee    side of islands in stronger Etesian winds.\nThe Meltemi occurs mainly during the summer season (June - September with 70%), but also in May and October one may frequently experience this dry wind.\nOne should anticipate its maximum during July and August.\nUsually the wind starts in the early afternoon reaching 4-5 Beaufort\nand dies out at sun set. However, not uncommonly it reaches 5-7 Bft during the day, perseveres during the night and blows 5-7 Bft again the next day; a pattern which can easily be repeated over many days, sometimes even up to ten days.\nIf during this period sailing to windward cannot be avoided, it can be very wise to lift anchor at dawn and to cover as many miles as possible before the wind starts\n.\n\u00a0\nImportant guidelines\nDue to the katabatic nature of the meltemi one can experience strong fall winds on the leeward side of the islands, notorious are Kea (we did survive though), Evvia, Tinos and Andros , Folegandros , Kos , Serifos , Amorgos and Sifnos . An orographic cloud to leeward of the mountain spells danger.\nWhen the wind encounters very high cliffs on the North shore of an island, a calm - extending several miles off shore - can be expected. Good examples are Amorgos, Paros and Naxos .\nIn the wide corridor between de dodecanese and cycladic islands the Meltemi blows undisturbed over 100 miles. Within six hours of a 30-knot wind, the waves can reach heights over three meters. The adverse currents make these waves steeper, which can be seriously dangerous for yachts smaller than 10 meter.\nThe Ionian Sea in the west of Greece is not affected by these Etesian winds but experiences a reliable Maistro wind throughout the sailing season. For an explanation on the Maistro wind please visit my page on Sailing routes in the Ionian .\nExpect funnelling winds, which can make certain straits dangerous to pass because of currents and higher wind velocities. Classical areas are: between Andros and Evvia (currents up to 5 knots!); between Ikaria and Samos till the Fournoi-archipelago; Between Paros and Naxos; North side of Amorgos; West side of Karpathos. Sometimes South of both Kea and Kythnos .\nTell-tales for your own Meltemi 24-36 hour prediction:\nHigher predicted atmospheric pressure over the Balkan/Northern Aegean.\nA sudden drop in humidity (first morning without dew on deck).\nScattered little altocumulus clouds one day in advance.\nA clear improvement of visibility combined with a raise in atmospheric pressure (4 hPa within 12 hours).\nFortunately, the possibility of stronger winds is actually the only shortcoming of the Aegean. There are hardly any shallow waters, no tides to speak off and no fog (good visibility!): all the ingredients for perfect yacht charter vacations .\nRelated pages:\n", "context_len": 955, "questions": ["What type of weather condition is a Meltemi?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Grace Slick", "Grace Wing", "Grace Barnett Wing"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nConcertmaster\nThe Concertmaster (from the German Konzertmeister) is the second-most significant person in an orchestra, symphonic band or other musical ensemble after the conductor or director.  Another common term in the U.S. is \"First Chair.\" In the U.K., the term commonly used is \"leader.\"\n\nOrchestra \n\nIn an orchestra, the concertmaster is the leader of the first violin section. There is another violin section, the second violins, led by the principal second violin. Any violin solo in an orchestral work is played by the concertmaster (except in the case of a concerto, in which case a guest soloist usually plays).  It is usually required that the concertmaster be the most skilled musician in the section, experienced at learning music quickly, counting rests accurately and leading the rest of the string section by his or her playing and bow gestures. \n\nThe concertmaster sits to the conductor's left, closest to the audience, in what is called the \"first chair,\" \"first stand\" or \"first desk\" (in the UK). He or she makes decisions regarding bowing and other technical details of violin playing for the violins, and sometimes all of the string players. The concertmaster leads the orchestra in tuning before concerts and rehearsals, and other technical aspects of orchestra management.  Leading the orchestral tuning is not just a mere formality; if the concertmaster believes that a section is not adequately tuned, he or she will signal to the oboe player to play another \"A.\" Several larger orchestras have one or more assistant concertmasters, who lead the orchestra in the concertmaster's absence.\n\nThe concertmaster, along with the conductor and section principals, will normally participate in the auditions of important musicians (e.g., principal players) in the orchestra.\n\nConcert band \n\nThe concertmaster in a standard concert band is the principal clarinet, oboe, flute or saxophone and leads the ensemble's tuning. The first-chair clarinet concertmaster will, in common practice, play all solos for their instrument. Often the lead flutist will receive similar responsibilities to the clarinet concertmaster, depending on several factors such as age, skill and time spent in the ensemble. The concertmaster will, in both orchestral and wind band settings, also coordinate with other principals and section leaders, in most cases being their senior in terms of group pecking order.\n\nBrass band \n\nIn brass bands, the role of concertmaster is often filled by the principal solo cornet or trumpet.\n\nDuties \n\nThe duties and tasks of the concertmaster are myriad. Primarily, they act as the conduit between conductor and orchestra and are accountable to both parties.\n\nOne of the principal tasks of the concertmaster is to provide bowings for the 1st violins prior to rehearsal. This entails a great knowledge of historical playing styles in addition to complete idiomatic understanding of the mechanics of string playing. Section leaders among the other strings will base their bowings on those of the concertmaster and these section leaders (called principals) may confer during rehearsal in order to ensure unity and cohesion of execution between the string sections. Ensemble cohesion emanates directly from the contact and connection between these vital front desk positions. The concertmaster assumes responsibility for the tone and execution of the entire section of 1st violins, in addition to performing any solo passages that occur in a given piece. \n\nAnother primary duty of the concertmaster is to translate instructions from the conductor into specific technical language for the strings. Some conductors prefer to speak more broadly and defer to the concertmaster on such matters out of respect for the musicians who are expert specialists while the conductor is by definition a generalist.     \n\nFull-time professional orchestras work with several conductors through the course of a regular season. Accordingly, while the conductor may change week to week or month to month, the concertmaster lends a sense of stable and constant leadership day to day. While the impetus for the orchestra to play is given by the conductor's gestures, oftentimes for reasons of precision, the orchestra will actually follow the bow of the concertmaster as their cue to play. This is because the conductor's gestures exist in the abstract whereas the concertmaster produces sound along with their fellow musicians. Further, the idiosyncratic technique of some conductors can make it difficult for the orchestra to enter together. Yet another duty of the concertmaster is to maintain a sense of decorum during rehearsals by setting a personal example and by monitoring the room to ensure all members of the orchestra are being cooperative. It is more appropriate for the concertmaster to ask for quiet if there is a bit of chatter than it is for a guest conductor unfamiliar with the orchestra.  \n  \nIn performances given in America and/or featuring American or British orchestras, the concertmaster will usually walk onstage individually after the rest of the orchestra is seated. They will bow and receive applause on behalf of the orchestra before the conductor appears. In continental European orchestras, this practice is uncommon. There, the concertmaster usually walks onstage with the rest of the orchestra. As the representative of the orchestra, he or she will usually shake hands with the conductor at the beginning or end of a concert as a sign of mutual respect and appreciation.\n", "context_len": 967, "questions": ["Traditionally, the leader of a symphony orchestra plays what?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Joberg", "Johannesburg", "Johannasberg", "Johannesburg, Southafrica", "Johannes-burg", "Johannesb'g", "JOHANNESBURG", "Yohannesburg", "Johannesburg, South Africa", "EGoli", "Johannesbourg", "Jhb", "Johansberg", "Johannesburg, Gauteng", "Jo'Bourg", "Johannesburg Civic Theatre", "Jozi", "Johannesburg, Transvaal", "Johannesgurg", "Joburg", "Johanessburg", "Visitor attractions in Johannesburg", "Jo'burg", "UN/LOCODE:ZAJNB", "Johanesburg"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

The satraps were made accountable to them so that the king might not suffer loss. 3\u00a0Now Daniel so distinguished himself among the administrators and the satraps by his exceptional qualities that the king planned to set him over the whole kingdom. 4\u00a0At this, the administrators and the satraps tried to find grounds for charges against Daniel in his conduct of government affairs, but they were unable to do so. They could find no corruption in him, because he was trustworthy and neither corrupt nor negligent. 5\u00a0Finally these men said, \u201cWe will never find any basis for charges against this man Daniel unless it has something to do with the law of his God.\u201d\n6\u00a0So these administrators and satraps went as a group to the king and said: \u201cMay King Darius live forever! 7\u00a0The royal administrators, prefects, satraps, advisers and governors have all agreed that the king should issue an edict and enforce the decree that anyone who prays to any god or human being during the next thirty days, except to you, Your Majesty, shall be thrown into the lions\u2019 den. 8\u00a0Now, Your Majesty, issue the decree and put it in writing so that it cannot be altered\u2014in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.\u201d 9\u00a0So King Darius put the decree in writing.\n10\u00a0Now when Daniel learned that the decree had been published, he went home to his upstairs room where the windows opened toward Jerusalem. Three times a day he got down on his knees and prayed, giving thanks to his God, just as he had done before. 11\u00a0Then these men went as a group and found Daniel praying and asking God for help. 12\u00a0So they went to the king and spoke to him about his royal decree: \u201cDid you not publish a decree that during the next thirty days anyone who prays to any god or human being except to you, Your Majesty, would be thrown into the lions\u2019 den?\u201d\nThe king answered, \u201cThe decree stands\u2014in accordance with the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be repealed.\u201d\n13\u00a0Then they said to the king, \u201cDaniel, who is one of the exiles from Judah, pays no attention to you, Your Majesty, or to the decree you put in writing. He still prays three times a day.\u201d 14\u00a0When the king heard this, he was greatly distressed; he was determined to rescue Daniel and made every effort until sundown to save him.\n15\u00a0Then the men went as a group to King Darius and said to him, \u201cRemember, Your Majesty, that according to the law of the Medes and Persians no decree or edict that the king issues can be changed.\u201d\n16\u00a0So the king gave the order, and they brought Daniel and threw him into the lions\u2019 den. The king said to Daniel, \u201cMay your God, whom you serve continually, rescue you!\u201d\n17\u00a0A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den, and the king sealed it with his own signet ring and with the rings of his nobles, so that Daniel\u2019s situation might not be changed. 18\u00a0Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night without eating and without any entertainment being brought to him. And he could not sleep.\n19\u00a0At the first light of dawn, the king got up and hurried to the lions\u2019 den. 20\u00a0When he came near the den, he called to Daniel in an anguished voice, \u201cDaniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve continually, been able to rescue you from the lions?\u201d\n21\u00a0Daniel answered, \u201cMay the king live forever! 22\u00a0My God sent his angel, and he shut the mouths of the lions. They have not hurt me, because I was found innocent in his sight. Nor have I ever done any wrong before you, Your Majesty.\u201d\n23\u00a0The king was overjoyed and gave orders to lift Daniel out of the den. And when Daniel was lifted from the den, no wound was found on him, because he had trusted in his God.\n24\u00a0At the king\u2019s command, the men who had falsely accused Daniel were brought in and thrown into the lions\u2019 den, along with their wives and children. And before they reached the floor of the den, the lions overpowered them and crushed all their bones.\n25\u00a0Then King Darius wrote to all the nations and peoples of every language in all the earth:\n\u201cMay you prosper greatly!\n26\u00a0\u201cI issue a decree that in every part of my kingdom people must fear and reverence the God of Daniel.\n\u201cFor he is the living God\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and he endures forever;\nhis kingdom will not be destroyed,\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0his dominion will never end.\n27\u00a0He rescues and he saves;\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0he performs signs and wonders\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0in the heavens and on the earth.\nHe has rescued Daniel\n\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0from the power of the lions.\u201d\n28\u00a0So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus[ b ] the Persian.\nFootnotes:\n", "context_len": 1046, "questions": ["In the Bible who put Daniel in the lions den?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Aston Villa", "Aston Villa F.C", "Aston Villa FC", "Villa News and Record", "Aston villa", "AVFC", "Aston Villa F C", "Aston vil", "Aston Villa F.

{"context": "\nThrush (bird)\nThrushes make up the Turdidae, a family of passerine birds that occurs worldwide.\n\nCharacteristics\n\nThrushes are plump, soft-plumaged, small to medium-sized birds, inhabiting wooded areas, and often feed on the ground. The smallest thrush may be the forest rock thrush, at 21 g and . However, the shortwings, which have ambiguous alliances with both thrushes and Old World flycatchers, can be even smaller. The lesser shortwing averages 12 cm. The largest thrush is the blue whistling thrush, at 178 g and 33 cm. The great thrush is similar in length, but less heavily built.  Most species are grey or brown in colour, often with speckled underparts.\n\nThey are insectivorous, but most species also eat worms, land snails, and fruit. Many species are permanently resident in warm climates, while others migrate to higher latitudes during summer, often over considerable distances.\n\nThrushes build cup-shaped nests, sometimes lining them with mud. They lay two to five speckled eggs, sometimes laying two or more clutches per year. Both parents help in raising the young.\n\nThe songs of some species, including members of the genera Catharus, Myadestes, Sialia and Turdus, are considered to be among the most beautiful in the avian world.  \n\nEcology\n\nTurdidae species spread the seeds of plants, contributing to the dispersal of many species and the recovery of ecosystems.\n\nPlants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time.\n\nMany bats and birds rely heavily on fruits for their diet, including birds in the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Rhamphastidae. While eating fruit, these animals swallow seeds and then later regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such ornithochory has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers.\n\nOther seeds may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of this sort. The Turdidae  have a great ecological importance because some populations migrate long distances and disperse the seeds of endangered plant species at new sites, helping to eliminate inbreeding and increasing the genetic diversity of local flora.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nThe taxonomic treatment of this large family has varied significantly in recent years. Traditionally, the Turdidae included the small Old World species, like the nightingale and European robin in the subfamily Saxicolinae, but most authorities now place this group in the Old World flycatcher family Muscicapidae.\n\nThe family formerly included more species. At the time of the publication of the third edition of Howard and Moore Complete Checklist of the Birds of the World in 2003, the genera Myophonus, Alethe, Brachypteryx and Monticola were included in Turdidae.

It is the British equivalent of the American Oscars and Australian AACTA Awards. As of 2008, it has taken place in Central London at the Royal Opera House, the latter having taken over from the flagship Odeon cinema on Leicester Square. The 69th British Academy Film Awards was held on 14 February 2016.\n\nHistory\n\nBritish Academy of Film and Television Arts (BAFTA) was founded in 1947 as The British Film Academy, by David Lean, Alexander Korda, Carol Reed, Charles Laughton, Roger Manvell and others. In 1958, the Academy merged with The Guild of Television Producers and Directors to form The Society of Film and Television, which eventually became The British Academy of Film and Television Arts in 1976.\n\nBAFTA stated charitable purpose is to \"support, develop and promote the art forms of the moving image, by identifying and rewarding excellence, inspiring practitioners and benefiting the public\". In addition to high profile awards ceremonies BAFTA runs a year-round programme of educational events including film screenings and tribute evenings. BAFTA is supported by a membership of about 6,000 people from the film, television and video game industries.\n\nThe Academy's awards are in the form of a theatrical mask designed by American sculptor Mitzi Cunliffe, which was commissioned by the Guild of Television Producers in 1955.\n\nAnnual ceremony\n\nThe ceremony previously took place in April or May and since 2002 it takes place in February in order to precede the Oscars. The awards are mostly open to all nationalities, though there is an award for Outstanding British Film and Outstanding Debut by a British Writer, Producer or Director. Only UK films are eligible for the categories of The British Short Film and British Short Animation awards.\n\nThe Awards ceremony is delayed broadcast on British television the same evening (usually BBC One), and across the world.

{"context": "\nTagus\nThe Tagus (; ; ; Ancient Greek: \u03a4\u03ac\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 Tagos) is the longest river on the Iberian Peninsula.  It is 1038 km long, 716 km in Spain, 47 km along the border between Portugal and Spain and 275 km in Portugal, where it empties into the Atlantic Ocean near Lisbon.  It drains an area of 80100 sqkm (the second largest in the Iberian peninsula after the Douro).  The Tagus is highly utilized for most of its course. Several dams and diversions supply drinking water to most of central Spain, including Madrid, and Portugal, while dozens of hydroelectric stations create power. Between dams it follows a very constricted course, but after Almourol it enters a vast alluvial valley prone to flooding. At its mouth is a large estuary on which the port city of Lisbon is situated.\n\nThe source of the Tagus is the Fuente de Garc\u00eda, in the Fr\u00edas de Albarrac\u00edn municipal term, Montes Universales, Sistema Ib\u00e9rico, Sierra de Albarrac\u00edn Comarca. All its major tributaries enter the Tagus from the right (north) bank.  The main cities it passes through are Aranjuez, Toledo, Talavera de la Reina and Alc\u00e1ntara in Spain, and Abrantes, Santar\u00e9m, Almada and Lisbon in Portugal.\n\nCourse\n\nIn Spain\n\nThe first notable city on the Tagus is Saced\u00f3n. Below Aranjuez it receives the combined flow of the Jarama,  Henares, Algodor and Taju\u00f1a.  Below Toledo it receives the Guadarrama River.  Above Talavera de la Reina it receives the Alberche.  At Valdeverdeja is the upper end of the long upper reservoir, the Embalse de Valdeca\u00f1as, beyond which are the Embalse de Torrejon, into which flow the Ti\u00e9tar, and the lower reservoir, the Alc\u00e1ntara Dam into which flows the Alag\u00f3n at the lower end.\n\nThere is a canal and aqueduct between the Tagus and the Segura.\n\nIn Portugal\n\nAfter forming the border it enters Portugal, passing Vila Velha de R\u00f3d\u00e3o, Abrantes, Const\u00e2ncia, Entroncamento, Santar\u00e9m and Vila Franca de Xira at the head of the long narrow estuary, which has Lisbon at its mouth. The estuary is protected by the Tagus Estuary Natural Reserve. There is the largest bridge across the river, the Vasco da Gama Bridge, which with a total length of  is the longest bridge in Europe.\n\nThe Portuguese Alentejo region and former Ribatejo Province take their names from the river; Alentejo, from al\u00e9m Tejo \"Beyond the Tagus\" and Ribatejo from arriba Tejo, an archaic way of saying \"Upper Tagus\".\n\nGeology\n\nThe lower Tagus is on a fault line. Slippage along it has caused numerous earthquakes, the major ones being those of 1309, 1531 and 1755. \n\nHistory\n\nThe Pepper Wreck, properly the wreck of the Nossa Senhora dos M\u00e1rtires, is a shipwreck located and excavated at the mouth of the Tagus between 1996 and 2001.\n\nThe river had strategic value to the Spanish and Portuguese empires, as it guarded the approach to Lisbon. For example, in 1587, Sir Francis Drake briefly approached the river after his successful raid at Cadiz. \n\nPopular culture\n\nA major river, the Tagus is brought to mind in the songs and stories of the Portuguese. A popular fado song in Lisbon notes that while people get older, the Tagus remains young (\"My hair getting white, the Tagus is always young\"). The author, Fernando Pessoa, wrote a poem that begins: \n\"The Tagus is more beautiful than the river that flows through my village. But the Tagus is not more beautiful than the river that flows through my village...\" \n\nRichard Crashaw's poem \"Saint Mary Magdalene, or the Weeper\" refers to the \"Golden\" Tagus as wanting Mary Magdalene's silver tears. In classical poetry the Tagus was famous for its gold-bearing sands (Catullus 29.19, Ovid, Amores, 1.15.34, Juvenal, Satires, 3.55, etc.).\n", "context_len": 723, "questions": ["Through which European capital city does the River Tagus flow?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Berkshire, England", "Highway, Berkshire", "Royal Country of Berkshire", "Berkshire", "Royal Berkshire", "County of Berkshire", "Royal County of Berkshire", "County of Berks"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

It is an international aid agency working to alleviate poverty and suffering in developing countries. It is funded by the Catholic community in England and Wales, the British Government and the general public by donations.\n\nCAFOD was founded in 1962. CAFOD's aims are to promote long-term development; respond to emergencies; raise public awareness of the causes of poverty; speak out on behalf of poor communities; and promote social justice in witness to Christian faith and gospel values. It is also involved in short-term relief.

{"context": "\nSlowhand\nSlowhand is the fifth studio album released by the British recording artist Eric Clapton. It was released on 25 November in 1977 by RSO Records. The release, titled after Clapton's nickname, is to this date one of his both commercially and musically most successful studio albums. Slowhand produced the two hit singles \"Lay Down Sally\" and \"Wonderful Tonight\", reached various international music charts and was honored with numerous awards and recording certifications. In 2012, a deluxe edition was released to celebrate the album's 35th anniversary.\n\nRecording\n\nClapton wanted to work with record producer Glyn Johns, because he thought Johns produced great work with famous groups like The Rolling Stones and The Eagles and understands how to work with both British and American musicians. While in the studio with Johns, Clapton notes that the A-list producer was very disciplined and disliked jamming, because it would kill important recording time. Although Clapton and his band were either drunk or stoned nearly all the time when recording, Johns liked Clapton's work and brought out the best in every musician, according to Clapton. \n\nTitle and artwork\n\nThe album was titled after Clapton's nickname, which was given to him by Giorgio Gomelsky. In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton recalled that the name \"Slowhand\" seemed to be hanging on to his real name, because it seemed to be well received by both his American friends and fans who think of the wild west when hearing the nickname. The album's artwork was done by Clapton himself with the help of Pattie Boyd and Dave Stewart, credited as \"El & Nell Ink\". Besides choosing various photos for the inner side of the gramophone record packaging are two pictures, Clapton notes, which have deeper importance to him: one picture, in which he kisses Boyd and another photograph showing a demolished Ferrari 365 GT4 BB, which Clapton bought after seeing George Harrison turning up with the same model at his Hurtwood Edge Estate. The car, which has been involved with Clapton in a car accident after the British recording artist finished touring in Australia, nearly killed him.\n\nRelease and reception\n\nSlowhand was released on 25 November 1977 by RSO Records.  In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, John Swenson found Clapton's playing more subtle than before but his songs sobering and interesting psychologically, especially \"Next Time You See Her\", as they showed him \"in touch with the horrible moral power and long-suffering self-righteousness that is the essence of the blues\".  Robert Christgau was less enthusiastic, lamenting how most of the record's best guitar solos were played by George Terry and feeling Clapton had regressed as a singer, \"sounding like he's blown his voice. Doing what, I wonder.\"\n\nIn a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the confident, virtuosic quality in the band's playing and the diversity of the songwriting made Slowhand \"rank with 461 Ocean Boulevard as Eric Clapton's best albums\". Yahoo! Music's Dave DiMartino said the record was full of hits and \"tasteful\" music.  In 2003, Slowhand was ranked number 325 on Rolling Stones list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. \n\nCensure in Argentina\n\nThe rock song \"Cocaine\" was censored and removed from the Argentinian edition of the album in late 1977. The military government of the time claimed that the song Clapton recorded was harmful to young people and inviting them to get high. The ban was finally lifted in 1984. Clapton felt indignation in later years after learning of censorship, since \"Cocaine\" is a song which is against drugs, and not to please as many people think. The musician once said that it is useless to intentionally write a song that goes against drugs and hope that people grasp the meaning. In \"Cocaine,\" an anti-drug perspective is communicated more effectively through an honest song whose cautionary message is apparent upon reflection.  After several years, Clapton began including the phrase 'that dirty cocaine' in live performances to highlight the anti-drug message of the song.  In addition, Clapton donated much of their funds to Crossroads Centre, a center that helps drug addicts to fight to stop drugs and rehabilitate themselves. \n\nDeluxe Edition\n\nIn November 2012, a remastered two-compact-disc 35th anniversary deluxe edition of Slowhand was released. The first disc consists of the remastered album, with additional bonus tracks and studio jam sessions. The second disc features a previously unreleased live concert, recorded in April 1977 at the Hammersmith Odeon; although the concert is of the same era as the Slowhand sessions, it was performed prior to the album's recording and release, and so does not include any of the album's tracks. \n\nTrack listings\n\nOriginal release\n\n2012 Deluxe edition\n\nPersonnel\n\n*Eric Clapton \u2013 lead vocals, guitar\n*Jamie Oldaker \u2013 drums, percussion\n*Carl Radle \u2013 bass guitar\n*Dick Sims \u2013 keyboards\n*George Terry \u2013 guitar\n\n*Mel Collins \u2013 saxophone\n*Yvonne Elliman \u2013 harmony and backing vocals\n*Marcy Levy \u2013 harmony and backing vocals, duet on 'The Core'\n*Glyn Johns \u2013 producer, engineer\n*El & Nell Ink. \u2013 Art design\n\nChart positions\n\nWeekly charts\n\nYear-end charts\n\nCertifications\n", "context_len": 966, "questions": ["Which guitarist is known as Slowhand?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["John Chilcot", "Sir John Chilcot"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nSpaghetti alla puttanesca\nSpaghetti alla puttanesca (; literally \"spaghetti in the style of a prostitute\" in Italian) is a tangy, somewhat salty Italian pasta dish invented in the mid-20th century.\n\nThe ingredients are typical of Southern Italian cuisine: tomatoes, olive oil, anchovies, olives, capers and garlic.\n\nOrigin\n\nVarious accounts exist as to when and how the dish originated, but it likely dates to the mid-twentieth century. The earliest known mention of it is in Raffaele La Capria\u2019s Ferito a Morte (Mortal Wound), a 1961 Italian novel which mentions \"spaghetti alla puttanesca come li fanno a Siracusa (spaghetti alla puttanesca as they make it in Syracuse)\".  The sauce became popular in the 1960s, according to the Professional Union of Italian Pasta Makers. \n\nThe 1971 edition of the Cucchiaio d\u2019argento (The Silver Spoon), one of Italy's most prominent cookbooks, has no recipe with this name, but two which are similar: The Neapolitan spaghetti alla partenopea, is made with anchovies and generous quantities of oregano; while spaghetti alla siciliana is distinguished by the addition of green peppers. Still again there is a Sicilian style popular around Palermo that includes olives, anchovies and raisins.  \n\nIn a 2005 article from Il Golfo\u2014a daily newspaper serving the Italian islands of Ischia and Procida\u2014Annarita Cuomo asserted that sugo alla puttanesca was invented in the 1950s by Sandro Petti, co-owner of Rancio Fellone, a famous Ischian restaurant and nightspot.   According to Cuomo, Petti's moment of inspiration came when\u2014near closing one evening\u2014Petti found a group of customers sitting at one of his tables. He was low on ingredients and so told them he didn't have enough to make them a meal. They complained that it was late and they were hungry. \"Facci una puttanata qualsiasi,\" or \"Make any kind of garbage,\" they insisted. Petti had nothing more than four tomatoes, two olives and some capers\u2014the basic ingredients for the sugo, \u201cSo I used them to make the sauce for the spaghetti,\u201d Petti told Cuomo.  Later, Petti included this dish on his menu as spaghetti alla puttanesca.\n\nBasic recipe\n\nThe sauce alone is called sugo alla puttanesca in Italian. Recipes may differ according to preferences; for instance the Neapolitan version is prepared without anchovies, unlike the version popular in Lazio, and chili peppers are sometimes added. In most cases, however, the sugo is a little salty (from the capers, olives, and anchovies) and quite fragrant (from the garlic). Traditionally, the sauce is served with spaghetti, although it also goes well with penne, bucatini, linguine and vermicelli.\n\nChopped garlic and anchovies (omitted in the Neapolitan version) are saut\u00e9ed in olive oil. Chopped chili peppers, olives, capers, diced tomatoes and oregano are added along with salt and black pepper to taste. The cook then reduces this mixture by simmering and pours it over spaghetti cooked al dente. The final touch is a topping of parsley. \n\nIn popular culture\n\nThe dish is featured in The Bad Beginning from the novel series A Series of Unfortunate Events by Lemony Snicket as the dish the Baudelaire children prepare at Count Olaf's house.  The dish also features prominently in the movie based on the novels. The dish is also featured in the opening scene of season 11, episode 10 of the TV series Bones. This dish also appears in Part 4 of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure, Diamond Is Unbreakable, in the story arc \"Let's Go Out for Italian Food\", where the Stand user Tonio Trussardi plants his Stand, Pearl Jam, into the food he makes in order to rid of his customer's health problems.\n", "context_len": 695, "questions": ["The hot and spicy dish Spaghetti Alla Puttanesca is named after what group of workers in Naples?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Kartoum", "Khartoum, SU", "Al Khar\u0163\u016bm", "Al-Khartoum, Sudan", "Khartoum (city)", "Al-Khar\u1e6d\u016bm", "Khartoum", "Capital of Sudan", "Chartum", "Al Khartum", "Khartum", "Al Khurtum", "Al-Khartum", "Khartoum, Sudan", "El Khartum", "Khartoum, The Sudan"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

It is constructed in accordance with a detailed set of specifications published by the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF). Its overall length must be at least 260 cm (102.4 inches) and its weight at least 800 grams (1.8 pounds). The women\u2019s javelin is somewhat shorter and lighter\u2014a minimum 220 cm (86.6 inches) long and 600 grams (1.3 pounds) in weight.\nJavelin throw, side view.\nEncyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc.\nAfter a short run, the javelin is thrown directly forward with an over-the-shoulder motion into a 29\u00b0 sector marked on the field. It must land point first. The thrower\u2019s body may not rotate a full turn (360\u00b0) before the javelin is released, and he may not step on or beyond a line at the end of the runway.\nScandinavian athletes dominated the first 50 years of men\u2019s javelin competition. Sweden conducted the first national championship in the event in 1896, and Swedish and Finnish athletes held most world records until 1953. The javelin throw has been an Olympic event since 1908; a women\u2019s javelin event was added to the Olympic program in 1932.\nLearn More in these related articles:\n", "context_len": 297, "questions": ["What Olympic event involves throwing a spear?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Basoon", "Bassoonist", "Bassoon", "French bassoon", "Buffet system", "BASSOON", "Fagott", "Bassoons", "Fagotto", "Pancake key (bassoon)", "Heckel system", "Basoonist", "Ba\u00dfoon", "Fagotte"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nEsure\nesure is an internet and telephone based insurance company based in Reigate, Surrey, England. It also has offices in Manchester and Glasgow. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index.\n\nHistory\n\nesure was founded in 2000 by businessman Peter Wood, who also launched the Direct Line insurance company for the Royal Bank of Scotland. In 2005 Peter Wood also Launched the highly successful insurance brand \"Sheilas' Wheels\". The brand is characterised by its three pink sequin-clad Sheilas who starred in a series of adverts made for the brand alongside a pink 'Sheilamobile'. The brand become one of the fastest selling insurance brands in the UK. Sheilas' Wheels focuses on women drivers but has offered cover to men too from its launch. The product includes benefits such as enhanced bag cover. \n\nesure is also known for its high-profile commercials with Michael Winner, used from 2002 to 2005 and resuming in 2007. The adverts spawned the phrase, \"Calm down dear, it's a commercial\".  Winner was temporarily replaced by Mr. Mouse, a blue animated mouse character with an American accent. Mr. Mouse was designed by Sian Vickers and Chris Wilkins, who came out of retirement at the request of Peter Wood, the founder of esure. The pair were responsible for the Smash Martians as well as the four-wheeled red telephone used by Direct Line in their publicity.  Mr. Mouse's catchphrases include \"Insurance at mices' prices!\" and \"Go on, give us a click!\". Mr Mouse was voiced by the actor and arts critic Kerry Shale. \n\nOn 21 November 2007, it was announced that esure would replace E.ON as the sponsor of ITV National Weather bulletins. The two-year deal, rumoured to be worth \u00a310 million, was negotiated by Carat Sponsorship and began on 1 January 2008. \n\nLloyds Banking Group sold its 70% stake in esure to esure Group Holdings, led by Peter Wood on 11 February 2010. The share was valued at around \u00a3185 million.  The company was listed on the London Stock Exchange in March 2013. \n\nOn the 8 December 2014, esure announced that it was acquiring the remaining 50% of shares in financial comparison website Gocompare.com having previously secured a non-controlling stake in the company.\n\nOperations\n\nesure is now one of the largest providers of motor insurance in the UK and also offers home and travel insurance. The company focuses on lower risk customers, offering cheaper premiums for customers with a current no claims bonus for its car insurance products. esure car insurance also incorporates the First Alternative brand which in the past offered quotes to higher risk customers as a separately authorised insurer but now sits as a small-scale sub-brand of esure.\n\nCriticism and concerns\n\nConcerns were raised in 2013 about potential conflict of interest. Esure's Peter Wood donated tens of thousands to the Conservatives and esure's Initial Public Offering (IPO) of February 2013 highlighted that insurance company friendly legislation of 2012 offered esure expansion potential. \"Quite evidently, Esure itself thought it was benefitting from the changes under new laws, as did Peter Wood personally, who made some \u00a3198 Million from the flotation\"; about a third of his shares. \n\nIn October 2014, esure faced criticism after it declined an insurance claim and offered only a \u2018goodwill payment\u2019 of \u00a35,000 on behalf of a policy holder whose abusive husband had set fire to her home. The husband pleaded guilty to effectively torturing his wife with an axe over a period of three days, and the non-payment of the policy left the victim homeless. In a statement, esure said they had \"utmost sympathy for the horrific incident\" but added that insurance was there to cover \"unexpected events and accidents, not deliberate and unlawful acts by individuals destroying their property\".\n\nConcerns were raised in 2014 about potential conflicts of interest when insurance companies own insurance comparison sites. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulations says such potential conflicts of interest must be 'flagged up'. A FCA report said \"Small print on the Gocompare.com website informs customers that it is 50% owned by Esure\" [esure owned 100% of GoCompare as of December 2014]. However, \"the FCA found no evidence that such firms had profited as a result of their potentially conflicting ownership.\"\n", "context_len": 809, "questions": ["In the first series of the Esure Insurance TV adverts, Michael Winner's famous quote was Calm down dear, it's only a what?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Beetroot", "Beet Root", "Beetroots", "Red beet", "Beets", "Beet root", "Beet (vegetable)", "Beet Juice", "Garden beet", "Beet", "Beet juice", "Table beet", "Beet leaves", "Beet greens"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nWhy Does It Always Rain on Me?\n\"Why Does It Always Rain on Me?\" is a song by Scottish band Travis, released as the third single from their second studio album, The Man Who.  The song became the group's international breakthrough single, receiving recognition around the world. It was their first Top 10 hit on the UK Singles Chart, peaking at number 10. The song also  peaked at number 11 in Australia, and achieved success in Japan and America. \n\nThe song was written by frontman Fran Healy who wrote the song while on holiday in Israel. He wanted to go somewhere sunny because in his hometown of Glasgow it rained all the time. In an interview at the Live 8 concert, he explained that he was spending a short holiday in the southern vacation city of Eilat, Israel in the middle of the winter.  The city is known for its hot weather even during winter time, but surprisingly it began to rain for two days during his stay. \n\nWhen Travis began to perform this song at the 1999 Glastonbury Festival, after being sunny for several hours, it began to rain exactly when the first line was sung.\n\nIn a poll by listeners of Absolute Radio the song was ranked 39th on a list of the top 100 songs of the 1990s.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe music video was directed by John Hardwick and filmed in Cornwall, with scenes filmed on Craddock Moor. The pool of water that the band jump into is part of a disused mining quarry known locally as \"Gold Digger's Mine\". The video features the band in a rain-soaked setting, with the band having locked frontman Healy, wearing a kilt, in the boot of a 1970s Vauxhall Viva. Healy escapes, and chases the rest of the band into a disused mining quarry. The video continues with the band being shown in a floating living room, performing the song.

{"context": "\nMick Hucknall\nMichael James \"Mick\" Hucknall  (born 8 June 1960) is an English pop singer and songwriter. Hucknall achieved international fame in the 1980s as the lead singer and songwriter of the soul-influenced pop band Simply Red, with whom he enjoyed a 25-year career and sold over 50 million albums. Hucknall is recognisable for his smooth, distinctive voice and wide vocal range, as well as his red curly hair, and has been described as \"one of the truly great blue-eyed soul singers\". \n\nEarly life\n\nHucknall, born at St Mary's Hospital, Manchester,   was an only child. His mother abandoned the family when he was three; the upheaval caused by this event inspired him to write \"Holding Back the Years,\" which would become one of Simply Red's biggest and best-known hits. He was brought up by his father, Reginald (1935\u20132009),  a barber in Stockport.  He attended Audenshaw School.  It would not be until the mid-1990s that he would finally reconnect with his mother, Maureen, who was by then living in Dallas. As of a 2008 interview, he had only seen her on two occasions since she first abandoned the family. \n\nMusic career \n\nHucknall was among the people present at the Lesser Free Trade Hall in Manchester in June 1976 where the Sex Pistols were playing.  His interest in the music scene led to the launch of his career in the late 1970s, when he was part of the formation of the band Frantic Elevators.\n\nThe Frantic Elevators released four singles, including a version of \"Holding Back the Years\", which he later recorded with Simply Red.\n\nAs lead singer and core member of Simply Red, he became the identifiable face of the band. His face and long curly red hair were featured prominently on album artwork and in videos.\n\nHucknall is also one of the founders and financial backers of the successful reggae label Blood and Fire. He also manages the record label simplyred.com.\n\nIn October 2007, on David Jensen's show on the Gold network, he announced Simply Red would split in 2009. \n\nIn 2008 Hucknall released his first solo album Tribute to Bobby, a tribute to the blues musician Bobby \"Blue\" Bland. \n\nIn June 2009, Hucknall took part in Songbook as part of the Sky Arts series, whereby music artists reflect on their favourite compositions and their background history in music.\n\nIn October 2009, Mick appeared at a charity performance as vocalist for a re-formed version of Faces, replacing Rod Stewart. In May 2010, it was announced that the new Faces line-up with Mick as frontman would be performing festival shows in 2010, followed by a world tour in 2011. \n\nIn October 2012, he released American Soul, a collection of his favourite music re-recorded with his vocals. During a series of interviews promoting the American Soul album, Hucknall revealed that he has also been working on an album of original material, to be released after American Soul has reached the end of its life cycle.\n\nPolitics \n\nHucknall is active in politics and is a prominent celebrity supporter of the UK Labour Party. In 1997, he declared his support for the Labour Party at that year's general election \u2013 which it won by a landslide under the leadership of Tony Blair to return to government after 18 years in opposition.  In 1998 Hucknall was named in a list of those who donated more than \u00a35,000 to the party.  In 2003, Hucknall backed Tony Blair's stance on Operation Iraqi Freedom, claiming he had \"more respect for Blair than ever\" and pointed out that British critics of the war were lucky to be living in a country where they could express their opinions. However, he claimed in 2008 that his conscience prevented him from donating to the party again because of the war, although he would still vote for them. \n\nHucknall has commented that derogatory references to his red hair are a form of bigotry. \n\nHucknall was a guest on the panel for the BBC's political discussion series Question Time, broadcast on 27 March 2014, and declared his support for same-sex marriage. \n\nPersonal life\n\nHucknall and his partner, Gabriella Wesberry, had a daughter, Romy True Hucknall, in June 2007.  Hucknall and Wesberry married in 2010, at the 16th-century Forter Castle in Glenisla, Perthshire, Scotland.  He spends a considerable amount of time in Ireland, where he purchased the Glenmore Estate near the village of Cloghan, County Donegal, with bandmate Chris De Margary. Hucknall and De Margary are keen fishermen, and operate a fishing and hunting tourism business from the estate.  \n\nHe co-owns Ask Property Development, a company that constructs city squares and public buildings. \n\nHe spends much time in Catania, Sicily, where he produces wines under the label \"Il Cantante\" (The Singer). \n\nHucknall is a Manchester United fan. \n\nHe has dated a handful of celebrities throughout his career.  In 2010, Hucknall admitted that in his most successful years, between 1985 and 1987, he would have sex with about three women a day and described himself as a sex addict. \n\nSolo discography\n\nAlbums\n\nSingles\n\nOther appearances\n\nIn 1986, he provided backup vocals for the musical film Little Shop of Horrors.\n", "context_len": 975, "questions": ["What is Mick Hucknell's band?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["The owl and the pussycat", "The Owl And The Pussycat", "The Owl and the Pussy Cat", "Owl and the Pussy Cat", "Goatlyboatly", "Owl and the Pussycat", "Goatly boatly", "Owl and the pussycat", "The Owl and the Pussycat", "The Owl and the Pussy-Cat"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nDushanbe\nDushanbe () is the capital and largest city of Tajikistan. Dushanbe means Monday in the Tajik language.   It was so named because it grew from a village that originally had a popular market on Mondays. Until 1929, the city was known in Russian as Dyushambe (), and from 1929 to 1961 as Stalinabad (, ). , Dushanbe has a population of 778,500.\n\nHistory\n\nSituated at the confluence of two rivers, Varzob and Kofarnihon, Dushanbe  is the capital of Tajikistan. Although archaeological remnants dating to the 5th century BC have been discovered in the area, there is little to suggest that Dushanbe was more than a small village until the early 20th century.\n\nThe first written mention of the village Dushanbe found at the end of 1676.  It was at the crossroads, where a large bazaar occurred on Mondays, hence the name Dushanbe-Bazar (, Dushanbe Bozor; )  from Dushanbe, which means Monday in the Persian language. In the village, there were more than 500 households and a population of about 8,000 people.\n\nBy 1826, the town was called Dushanbe Qurghan (, Dushanbe Qurghon; , with the suffix qur\u01a3on from Turkic qur\u011fan, meaning \"fortress\") Russified as Dyushambe ().  The first map showing Dyushambe was drafted in 1875.  At that time, the town was a fortress on a steep bank on the left bank of the Varzob River with 10,000 residents.\n\nIn 1920, the last Emir of Bukhara briefly took refuge in Dyushambe after being overthrown by the Bolshevik revolution. He fled to Afghanistan after the Red Army conquered the area the next year.  At the beginning of 1922, the town was taken by Basmachi troops led Enver Pasha, but on 14 July 1922 again came under the power of the Bolsheviks and was proclaimed the capital of the Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic as a part of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic in 1924.\n\nA Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic separate from the Uzbek SSR was created in 1929, and its capital Dyumshambe was renamed Stalinabad (Russian: ; Tajik:   Stalinobod) for Soviet dictator Joseph Stalin on 16 October 1929.  In the years that followed, the city developed at a rapid pace.\n\nThe Soviets transformed the area into a centre for cotton and silk production, and tens of thousands of people relocated to the city. The population also increased with thousands of Tajiks migrating to Tajikistan following the transfer of Bukhara and Samarkand to the Uzbek SSR as part of national delimitation in Central Asia. \n\nOn 10 November 1961, Stalinabad was renamed Dushanbe, the name it retains to this day.\n\nSevere rioting occurred in February 1990, after it was rumored that the Soviet government planned to relocate tens of thousands of Armenian refugees to Tajikistan. The Dushanbe riots were primarily fueled by concerns about housing shortages for the Tajik population, but they coincided with a wave of nationalist unrest that swept Transcaucasia and other Central Asian states during the twilight of Gorbachev's era. \n\nClimate\n\nDushanbe features a Mediterranean climate (K\u00f6ppen: Csa), with strong continental climate influences (K\u00f6ppen: Dsa).  The summers are hot and dry and the winters are chilly, but not very cold. The climate is damper than other Central Asian capitals, with an average annual rainfall over 500 mm as moist air is funnelled by the surrounding valley during the winter and spring. Winters are not as cold as further north owing to the shielding of the city by mountains from extremely cold air from Siberia.

{"context": "\nRiver Itchen, Hampshire\nThe River Itchen (previously also known as the River Alre) is a river in Hampshire, England. It flows from mid-Hampshire to join with Southampton Water below the Itchen Bridge in the city of Southampton. The river has a total length of 28 mi, and is noted as one of the world's premier chalk streams for fly fishing,  especially using dry fly or nymphing techniques. The local chalk in the earth provides excellent filtration and thus watercress thrives all along the Itchen valley in its once pristine, crystal clear waters, now affected by pollution by some farming practices. It is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and is noted for its high-quality habitats, supporting a range of protected species including the endangered water vole,  otter, brook lamprey and white-clawed crayfish.\n\nThe river is managed by the Environment Agency, whilst the Port of Southampton is the navigation authority for the tidal section below Swaythling.\n\nDuring Roman Britain, the river may have been associated with the Celtic goddess Ancasta.\n\nEtymology\n\nThe origin of the name is thought to be very ancient and pre-Celtic; the meaning is unknown. The settlement of Itchen Abbas on the river is given as Icene in the Domesday Book of 1086. \n\nCourse\n\nThe source of the Itchen is situated just south of the village of Cheriton. Initially the river flows north, through the villages of Cheriton and Tichborne, before joining up with its tributaries the River Alre and the Candover Brook, just below the town of New Alresford. The river then flows west down the upper Itchen Valley passing the villages of Avington, Itchen Stoke, Itchen Abbas, Martyr Worthy, Easton, and Abbots Worthy. Before entering the historic city of Winchester it crosses Winnall Moors. \n\nThe river flows in several different channels through the city of Winchester, some of which come close enough to Winchester Cathedral to have caused serious problems to the building's foundations in earlier years. The main channel flows through Winchester City Mill and to the east of the city's Roman walls, along a promenaded reach known as \"The Weirs\".\n\nThe river then heads south, through a series of water meadows, passing the Hospital of St Cross, the villages of Twyford and Shawford, between the town of Eastleigh and the village of Bishopstoke and through Itchen Valley Country Park before reaching the northern suburbs of Southampton at Mansbridge. Between Winchester and Mansbridge, sections of the river were once deepened or widened as part of the long disused Itchen Navigation, and the former towpath forms part of the Itchen Way. \n\nMonks Brook flows into the Itchen at Swaythling, and the river then passes under Woodmill Bridge and becomes tidal. Four further bridges cross the river before its confluence with the River Test estuary in Southampton Water:\n\n* Cobden Bridge, a road bridge connecting Bitterne Park and St Denys.\n* The bridge carrying the Southampton \u2013 Portsmouth railway line.\n* Northam Bridge, a road bridge carrying the A3024 road from Bitterne Manor to Northam, which was originally opened in 1799.\n* The Itchen Bridge, a high-level toll road bridge connecting the docks area with Woolston. This replaced the Woolston Floating Bridge (a chain ferry) which had previously crossed the river at this point.\n\nBetween the latter two bridges, the river passes St Mary's Stadium, the home of Southampton F.C.

Because they are deemed to have no influence on reported financial results, by-products do not receive allocations of joint costs. By-products also by convention are not inventoried, but the NRV from by-products is typically recognized as 'other income' or as a reduction of joint production processing costs when the by-product is produced.

Richard was born in Manchester, Lancashire, near Christmas 1847 as Richard Horatio Marriott; both his two sisters, Adeline Marriott (b. 1853) and Grace Marriott (b. 1858) were also born in Lancashire.

Polly had invented an obligation in London to hide her pregnancy and give birth in secret on 1 April 1875, almost a month after Richard and Jenny married. This son became the famous journalist, novelist, playwright and screenplay writer Edgar Wallace.\n\nRichard and Jenny Taylor's children were Alice Marriott Edgar (b. 1876, London), twins Richard and Jennifer Marriott Edgar (b. 1878, London), after whose births the family moved to Scotland where George was born, then  returning to London where Joseph Marriott Edgar was born in 1884 and Adeline Alice Edgar in 1886.\n\nEarly career\n\nLittle is recorded of George Marriott Edgar's early career, but he was talented performer, poet and writer. His first real successes began after he had been in the cast of The Co-Optimists and worked with Stanley Holloway.[http://www.classicsonline.com/catalogue/product.aspx?pid\n718 Cary Ginell on Stanley Holloway at classicsonline.com] At the start of the 1930s they went to Hollywood, where Edgar - who had dropped his first name for the professional appellation Marriott Edgar - met his famous half-brother.\n\nMonologues\n\nHolloway was already enjoying some success with the monologue format, with such classics as Sam, Pick Oop Tha' Musket. Edgar asked him if he had heard a story about a couple who had taken their son to the zoo, only to see the lad eaten by a lion.  Holloway had indeed heard the story, and shortly afterwards Edgar supplied him with a script.  The Lion and Albert became one of Holloway's most popular pieces, one of many he recorded beginning in 1930. The lion of the poem is named \"Wallace\", which was the name of the first African lion to be bred in Britain, living from 1812 until 1838, and his name became a popular one for lions.[http://www.ravishingbeasts.com/lions/2006/11/3/wallace-the-lion.html Wallace the lion at ravishingbeasts.com] Edgar gave the poem the titleThe Lion and Albert but some later performances and re-publications used the form Albert and the Lion.[http://www.seiyaku.com/lit/monologues/003.html The Lion and Albert ] The nearby pub also uses the latter form.\n\nThe monologues were designed to be spoken rhythmically, with piano accompaniment which in many cases was also composed by Edgar.for examples see The texts were published by Francis, Day & Hunter during the 1930s in three collections.

{"context": "\nCobalt blue\nCobalt blue is a blue pigment made by sintering cobalt(II) oxide with alumina at 1200\u00a0\u00b0C. Chemically, cobalt blue pigment is cobalt(II) oxide-aluminium oxide, or cobalt(II) aluminate, CoAl2O4. Cobalt blue is lighter and less intense than the (iron-cyanide based) pigment  Prussian blue. It is extremely stable and has historically been used as a coloring agent in ceramics, (especially Chinese porcelain), jewelry, and paint. Transparent glasses are tinted with the silica-based cobalt pigment smalt.\n\nHistorical uses and production\n\nCobalt blue in impure forms had long been used in Chinese porcelain,  but it was independently discovered as a pure alumina-based pigment by Louis Jacques Th\u00e9nard in 1802.  Commercial production began in France in 1807. The first recorded use of cobalt blue as a color name in English was in 1777.  The leading world manufacturer of cobalt blue in the 19th century was Benjamin Wegner's Norwegian company Blaafarvev\u00e6rket, (\"blue colour works\" in Dano-Norwegian). Germany was also famous for production, especially the blue colour works (Blaufarbenwerke) in the Ore Mountains of Saxony.\n\nCobalt blue in human culture\n\nArt\n* Watercolorist and astrologer John Varley suggested cobalt blue as a good substitution for ultramarine for painting skies, writing in his \"List of Colours\" from 1818: \"Used as a substitute for Ultramarine in its brightness of colour, and superior when used in skies and other objects, which require even tints; used occasionally in retrieving the brightness of those tines when too heavy, and for tints in drapery, etc. Capable, by its superior brilliancy and contrast, to subdue the brightness of other blues.\" \n* Cobalt blue has been used in paintings since its discovery by Th\u00e9nard by painters such as Turner, the Impressionists such as Renoir, Monet and Post-Impressionists such as Van Gogh.  It is stable and lightfast and also compatible with all other pigments.\n* Maxfield Parrish, famous partly for the intensity of his skyscapes, used cobalt blue, and cobalt blue is sometimes called Parrish blue as a result.\n* Cobalt blue was the primary blue pigment used in Chinese blue and white porcelain for centuries, beginning in the late 8th or early 9th century. \nAutomobiles\n* Several car manufacturers including Jeep and Bugatti have cobalt blue as one paint options.\nConstruction\n* Because of its chemical stability in the presence of alkali, cobalt blue is used as a pigment in blue concrete.\nGlassmaking\n* The blue seen on many glassware pieces is cobalt blue, and it is used widely by artists in many other fields.\n* Cobalt glass almost perfectly filters out the bright yellow emission of ionized sodium.\nOphthalmology\n*Cobalt blue is used as a filter used in ophthalmoscopes, and is used to illuminate the cornea of the eye following application of fluorescein dye which is used to detect corneal ulcers and scratches.\nSports\n* Major League Soccer's Sporting Kansas City have had cobalt blue as the secondary color of its home uniforms since 2008. \nVexillology\n* Several countries including the Netherlands and Romania, and a U.S. state - Nevada - have cobalt blue as one of three shades of their flags.\nVideo Games\n* Sega's official logo color is cobalt blue.

They are usually applied by the diner, but are sometimes added prior to serving; for example, in a sandwich made with ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise. Some condiments are used during cooking to add flavor or texture to the food; barbecue sauce,  compound butter, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, and marmite are examples.\n\nThe term condiment comes from the Latin condimentum, meaning \"spice, seasoning, sauce\" and from the Latin condere, meaning \"preserve, pickle, season\". \n\nDefinition\n\nThe exact definition of what is and is not a condiment varies. Some definitions include spice and herbs, including salt and pepper,  using the term interchangeably with seasoning.  Others restrict the definition to including only \"prepared food compound[s], containing one or more spices\", which are added to food after the cooking process, such as mustard, ketchup or mint sauce. Cheese is also considered a condiment in some European countries.\n\nHistory\n\nCondiments were known in Ancient Rome, Ancient India, Ancient Greece and Ancient China, and were often used to improve the taste of spoiling food; before food preservation techniques were widespread, pungent spices and condiments were used to make the food more palatable.

The duffel coat may have initially come from the Polish military frock coat, which was developed in the 1820s. The hood and toggle fastenings proved popular and it spread across Europe by the 1850s. By 1890 it was being supplied to the British Royal Navy, and Field Marshal Montgomery was a famous wearer of the coat in World War II. After the war, the coats became available as government surplus stock and became popular, especially with students.\n\nThe coat is made of dense woollen cloth, and distinctive features include a capacious hood that can be worn over a uniform cap, three or four wood or horn toggles with leather loops for ease of fastening when wearing gloves, a buttonable strap neck and two large outside patch pockets. Early versions were knee-length but later ones were shorter. Modern coats are made in a softer woollen material. The coat has had many notable wearers and is associated with left-wing politics.\n\nDescription\n\nThere are many varying styles to the duffel coat, although the original British style would be composed of the following features:\n* Made of genuine double weave Duffel, lined with a woolly tartan pattern, or self-coloured on the wartime version.\n* A buttonable neck strap.\n* Three or later, four front wooden or horn toggle-fastenings with rope or leather loops to attach them to, thus also known as a \"toggle coat,\" especially in the United States.\n* Two large outside patch pockets, with covering flaps on post-war versions.\n* Originally knee length, shorter on later versions.\n* Bucket hood with press stud adjustment. Later versions feature a neater \"pancake\" hood.\n\nThe wooden toggle-fastenings were made to be easily fastened and unfastened while wearing gloves in cold weather at sea. Current designs often have toggles made of buffalo horn, or plastic. The oversized hood offered enough room to wear over a Naval cap.\n\nAfter rain, a duffle coat has a characteristic smoky smell.\n\nHistory\n\nThe initial influence of what became the duffle coat, may have been the hooded Polish military frock coat, which was developed in the 1820s. It had the unusual features of a toggle closure and an integrated hood,  and by 1850 had spread through Europe.[http://www.gentlemansgazette.com/duffle-coat-guide-history-details/ \"Duffle coat history\"] Gentleman's Gazette In the 1850s, outerwear manufacturer John Partrige developed the first version of the duffle coat.[http://angelasancartier.net/duffle-coat \"Duffle coat\"], Encyclopedia of clothing and fashion\n\nIn the 1890s the British Admiralty chose a number of manufacturers to produce duffle coats for the British Royal Navy,  where it was referred to as the \"convoy coat\"  The navy issued a camel-coloured variant of it as an item of warm clothing during World War I,\n\nThe design of the coat was modified slightly and widely issued during World War II. Field Marshal Montgomery was a famous wearer of the coat,  as a means of identifying himself with his troops, leading to another nickname, \"Monty coat\".\n\nLarge stocks of post-war military surplus coats available at reasonable prices to the general public meant that these coats became a ubiquitous and popular item of clothing in the 1950s and 1960s especially among students. The British firm Gloverall purchased surplus military supply of coats after World War II, and in 1954 started producing their own version of the Duffle coat using leather fastenings and Buffalo horn toggles with a double-faced check back fabric, and many other modern versions copy some or all of those features. \n\nModern times\n\nIn modern times, the type of fabric used to make duffel coats is known as Melton cloth, as opposed to modern duffel cloth which is a softer wool fabric with a distinct nap, used for high-end coats and parkas.\n\nNoted wearers\n\nIn the 1949 movie The Third Man, a main character, British Major Calloway (Trevor Howard), wears a duffle coat in nearly all of his scenes.\n\nFor many years they were seen in the popular press as a form of uniform for stereotyped supporters of the left wing, as characterised by Labour leader Michael Foot. Other famous duffle coat wearers include members of Scottish band Belle and Sebastian, American businessman David Woodard, English actor Dudley Moore, television character Jonathan Creek, children's book and television character Paddington Bear, Ed Helms as Andy Bernard in the American version of the popular British television comedy show The Office, and all members of the English rock music group Oasis on the cover of their 1995 hit single \"Roll with it\".\n", "context_len": 886, "questions": ["Duffel coats were named after a town in which country?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Ontario (canada)", "Ontario", "Ontario Canada", "ON, Canada", "Canada Ontario", "Ontairo", "Ontarian", "Climate of Ontario", "Ontario, Canada", "Province of Ontario", "CA-ON", "Ontario (Canada)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nLaver (seaweed)\nLaver is an edible, littoral alga (seaweed). In Wales, laver is used for making laverbread, a traditional Welsh dish. Laver as food is also commonly found around the west coast of Great Britain and east coast of Ireland along the Irish Sea, where it is also known as slake. \nIt is smooth in texture and forms delicate, sheetlike thalli, often clinging to rocks. The principal variety is purple laver (Porphyra umbilicalis).  Purple laver is classified as a red alga, tends to be a brownish colour, but boils down to a dark green pulp when prepared.  It is unusual amongst seaweeds because the fronds are only one cell thick.    Laver has a high content of dietary minerals, particularly iodine and iron. The high iodine content gives the seaweed a distinctive flavour in common with olives and oysters. \n\nPorphyra is also consumed in East Asia, where it is known as zicai (\u7d2b\u83dc) in China,  in Japan, and gim (\uae40) in Korea.\n\nUlva lactuca, a green alga, also known as sea lettuce, is occasionally eaten as green laver, which is regarded as inferior to the purple laver. \n\nCultivation\n\nLaver cultivation as food is thought to be very ancient, though the first mention was in Camden's Britannia in the early 17th century.  It is plucked from the rocks and given a preliminary rinse in clear water. The collected laver is repeatedly washed to remove sand and boiled for hours until it becomes a stiff, green mush.  In this state, the laver can be preserved for about a week. Typically during the 18th century, the mush was packed into a crock and sold as \"potted laver\".\n\nCultivation of laver is typically associated with Wales, and it is still gathered off the Pembrokeshire and Carmarthenshire coasts,  although similar farming methods are used at the west coast of Scotland.\n\nLaver can be eaten cold as a salad with lamb or mutton. A simple preparation is to heat the laver and to add butter and the juice of a lemon or Seville orange. Laver can be heated and served with boiled bacon. It is used to make the Welsh dish known as laverbread.\n\nLaverbread\n\nLaverbread ( or ') is a traditional Welsh delicacy made from laver. To make laverbread, the seaweed is boiled for several hours, then minced or pureed. The gelatinous paste that results can then be sold as it is, or rolled in oatmeal; it is generally coated with oatmeal prior to frying.\n\nLaverbread is traditionally eaten fried with bacon and cockles as part of a Welsh breakfast. It can also be used to make a sauce to accompany lamb, crab, monkfish, etc., and to make laver soup (').  Richard Burton has been quoted as describing laverbread as \"Welshman's caviar\". \n\nLaver is often associated with Penclawdd and its cockles, being used traditionally in the Welsh diet and is still eaten widely across Wales in the form of laverbread. In addition to Wales, laverbread is eaten across the Bristol Channel in North Devon, especially around the Exmoor coast around Lynmouth, Combe Martin and Ilfracombe.  In North Devon it is generally not cooked with oatmeal and it is simply referred to as 'Laver' (lay-ver).\n\nLaver is highly nutritious because of its high proportions of protein, iron, and especially iodine. It also contains high  levels of vitamins B2, A, D and C. Dried purple laver contains high amounts of vitamin B12.\n", "context_len": 656, "questions": ["What is the main ingredient of Laverbread?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["James bLUNT", "James blunt", "JAMES BLUNT", "Blunty", "James Blunt", "James Hillier Blount", "Blunt, James"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nPisiform bone\nThe pisiform bone ( or), also spelled pisiforme (from the Latin pisifomis, pea-shaped), is a small knobbly, pea-shaped bone that is found in the wrist. It forms the ulnar border of the carpal tunnel.\n\nStructure\n\nThe pisiform bone is a small bone found in the proximal row of the wrist (carpus). It is situated where the ulna joins the wrist, within the tendon of the flexor carpi ulnaris muscle. \n\nIt only has one side that acts as a joint, articulating with the triquetral bone. It is on a plane anterior to the other carpal bones and is spheroidal in form.\n\nThe pisiform bone has four surfaces:\n# The dorsal surface is smooth and oval, and articulates with the triquetral: this facet approaches the superior, but not the inferior border of the bone.\n# The palmar surface is rounded and rough, and gives attachment to the transverse carpal ligament, the flexor carpi ulnaris and the abductor digiti quinti.\n# The lateral and medial surfaces are also rough, the former being concave, the latter usually convex.\n\nFunction\n\nUnlike the other carpal bones, the pisiform is not involved in movement of the wrist.  \n\nHistory\n\nThe etymology derives from the Latin p\u012bsum which means \"pea\".\n\nOther animals\n\nAs compared with apes, which have an elongated Pisiform, humans have a shorter pisiform bone. This is due to the loss of the single growth plate typically found in other mammalian pisiforms. This may be because of evolutionary benefits from having a shorter pisiform bone, including facilitating ulnar deviation of the hand, and preventing hyperextension of the wrist, actions that improve the action of clubbing.\n", "context_len": 311, "questions": ["Pisiform and hamate are bones in which part of the human body?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Boddington's", "Boddingtons Brewery", "Boddingtons", "Boddington Group"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

The snowy slopes beckon and the urge to hurtle down them takes over but there is no sledge available. So you grab a tea tray, an old bag, a coat \u2013 or, if you are a police officer, a riot shield.\nA group of officers from Thames Valley police have been reprimanded after one showed his ability to improvise by using a shield to fly down a hill in Oxfordshire.\nUrged on by colleagues, he sat on the riot shield, grabbed on to the handles that could have been designed for this purpose and shot down the hill to hoots of laughter. Unfortunately for the officers, the escapade was filmed by an onlooker and posted on YouTube . The officers' bosses were not amused.\nSuperintendent Andrew Murray, Oxford city commander, said: \"The snow has a habit of bringing out the child in all of us. I have spoken to the officers concerned and reminded them in no uncertain terms that tobogganing on duty, on police equipment and at taxpayers' expense, is a very bad idea should they wish to progress under my command.\"\nThe incident happened on Boars Hill in Oxford. The 41-second clip shows five or six officers, some also recording the adventure on their own cameras, in the snowy field, a police van parked in the background. One of the officers plonks the shield on the slope and is advised by another to hold on to the handles. He settles himself, holds tight and then two pals give him an almighty push.\nSquealing, the officer slides off, one of his colleagues advising him: \"Whatever happens, keep smiling.\" The shield proves to be an effective sledge, even skipping over a ditch at the foot of the hill.\nRick Latham, who filmed the clip on Tuesday, initially thought police were going to tell him off for attempting to get down the slope in a kayak. \"They pulled up and we thought they were going to give us a hard time. Then they asked how slippery the snow was and one of them grabbed the shield. I asked if I could film it and they said that was fine. They said something like 'We're only human'.\"\nLatham said he hoped the officers were not severely reprimanded. \"You don't always build up the most positive image of the police but they broke the mould. They were chatty and pleasant. It was just nice to see them in that situation.\"\nWeather forecasters warn of heavy rain in western England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland\nPublished: 14 Jan 2010\nWhere do all those thousands of tonnes of rock salt end up, asks Leo Hickman\nPublished: 13 Jan 2010\nEditorial: Feeding birds this month offers a rare chance to see redpolls, yellowhammers and tree sparrows among the robins, finches and tits that more often make up backyard populations.

{"context": "\n15 minutes of fame\n15 minutes of fame is short-lived media publicity or celebrity of an individual or phenomenon. The expression is credited to Andy Warhol, who included the words \"In the future, everyone will be world-famous for 15 minutes\" in the program for a 1968 exhibition of his work at the Moderna Museet in Stockholm, Sweden.  Photographer Nat Finkelstein claims credit for the expression, stating that he was photographing Warhol in 1966 for a proposed book. A crowd gathered trying to get into the pictures and Warhol supposedly remarked that everyone wants to be famous, to which Finkelstein replied, \"Yeah, for about fifteen minutes, Andy.\" \n\nThe phenomenon is often used in reference to figures in the entertainment industry or other areas of popular culture, such as reality television and YouTube.\n\nThe statement may be an adaptation of an idea by Marshall McLuhan explaining how TV differs from other media using contestants. An older version of the same concept in English is the expression \"nine days' wonder\", which dates at least as far back as the Elizabethan era.\n\nInterpretation\n\nGerman art historian Benjamin H. D. Buchloh suggests that the core tenet of Warhol's aesthetic, being \"the systematic invalidation of the hierarchies of representational functions and techniques\" of art, corresponds directly to the belief that the \"hierarchy of subjects worthy to be represented will someday be abolished,\" hence anybody, and therefore \"everybody,\" can be famous once that hierarchy dissipates, \"in the future,\" and by logical extension of that, \"in the future, everybody will be famous,\" and not merely those individuals worthy of fame. \n\nOn the other hand, wide proliferation of the adapted idiom \"my fifteen minutes\"     and its entrance into common parlance have led to a slightly different application, having to do with both the ephemerality of fame in the information age and, more recently, the democratization of media outlets brought about by the advent of the internet.Frederick Levy, 15 Minutes of Fame: Becoming a Star in the YouTube Revolution, Penguin Group, 2008, ISBN 978-1-59257-765-1. In this formulation, Warhol's quote has been taken to mean: \"At the present, because there are so many channels by which an individual might attain fame, albeit not enduring fame, virtually anyone can become famous for a brief period of time.\"\n\nThere is a third and even more remote interpretation of the term, as used by an individual who has been legitimately famous or skirted celebrity for a brief period of time, that period of time being his or her \"fifteen minutes.\" \n\nJohn Langer suggests that 15 minutes of fame is an enduring concept because it permits everyday activities to become \"great effects.\"John Langer, Tabloid television: popular journalism and the \"other news\", Routledge, 1998, ISBN 978-0-415-06636-5, page 51, 63, 73 Tabloid journalism and the paparazzi have accelerated this trend, turning what may have before been isolated coverage into continuing media coverage even after the initial reason for media interest has passed.\n\nDerivative phrases\n\nIn the song \"I Can't Read\", released by David Bowie's Tin Machine in their 1989 debut album and re-released by Bowie in 1997 for the soundrack of the movie The Ice Storm, the phrase is used in direct reference to Andy Warhol: \"Andy, where's my 15 minutes?\" \nThe age of reality television has seen the comment wryly updated as: \"In the future, everyone will be obscure for 15 minutes.\"  The British artist Banksy has made a sculpture of a TV that has, written on its screen, \"In the future, everyone will be anonymous for 15 minutes,\"  which was later used in the lyrics of Robbie Williams' song \"The Actor\" from his 2006 album Rudebox.\n\nA more recent adaptation of Warhol's quip, possibly prompted by the rise of online social networking, blogging, and internet celebrity, is the claim that \"In the future, everyone will be famous to fifteen people\" or, in some renditions, \"On the Web, everyone will be famous to fifteen people\".  This quote, though attributed to David Weinberger, was said to have originated with the Scottish artist Momus.\n\nThe Marilyn Manson song \"I Don't Like the Drugs (But the Drugs Like Me)\", released on his 1998 album Mechanical Animals, alludes to the term in the line \"We're rehabbed and we're ready for our fifteen minutes of shame\", as part of the song's theme of unrepentant escapism through drugs.\n\nAlso the group Queensryche uses the words \"I guess Warhol wasn't wrong / Fame fifteen Minutes Long\" in their famous 1988 anti-hero telltale album Operation: Mindcrime song, as a way of showing the deterioration of society to reach its aim.\n", "context_len": 908, "questions": ["Who said that in the future everyone would be famous for fifteen minutes?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Russia (1991-1993)", "\u041e\u0440\u043e\u0441\u044b\u043d \u0425\u043e\u043b\u0431\u043e\u043e\u043d\u044b \u0423\u043b\u0441", "Etymology of Russia", "The Russian federation", "\u0420\u04d9\u0441\u04d9\u0439", "ISO 3166-1:RU", "Russia (1990-1993)", "\u0420\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0439", "Novaya russia", "\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u044f", "\u0420\u0430\u04ab\u04ab\u0435\u0439", "\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f", "Poccnr", "\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0456\u044f", "\u041e\u0440\u043e\u0434\u043e\u0439 \u0425\u043e\u043b\u0431\u043e\u043e\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0423\u043b\u0430\u0441", "\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0438", "The Russian Federation", "Russsia", "Russian (citizen)", "\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u0439\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0301\u0446\u0438\u044f", "\u0423\u0440\u044b\u0441\u0435\u0439", "\u0410\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0441\u044b\u044b\u0439\u0430", "Rossiyskaya Federatsiya", "\u041e\u044c\u0440\u0441\u0438\u0439\u043d \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0439", "Russian-born", "\u0410\u044c\u0440\u0430\u0441\u0430\u0442", "Russia (Federation)", "POCCNR", "Northern Russia", "Federation of Russia", "Russia (country)", "\u0420\u043e\u0447\u043c\u0443", "\u0420\u0435\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f\u0441\u044b", "Venaja", "\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438\u044f", "\u0423\u0440\u044b\u0441\u0442\u04d9\u044b\u043b\u0430", "Resey", "\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f", "Wildlife of Russia", "The Country Russia", "\u0423\u00e6\u0440\u00e6\u0441\u0435", "Venaejae", "Russian federation", "Russie", "Russia", "Rossijskaja Federatsija", "RUSSIA", "Ryssland", "Russian Federation", "Russiya", "\u0420\u0443\u0441\u0438\u0458\u0430", "RusSia", "\u041e\u0440\u0441\u0438\u043d \u041d\u0438\u0438\u0446\u04d9\u043d", "Russland", "\u0420\u0443\u0437\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440", "RussiA"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

Known for his signature raspy voice, Stewart performed in several U.K. bands in the 1960s. Embarking on a solo career, \"Maggie May\" became his first hit single in 1971. Moving to the U.S. in 1975, Stewart's hit songs included \"Tonight's the Night\" (1976) and \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\" (1978). He experienced a career lull during the 1980s and only had a few hits in the 1990s, but came back strong singing the classics in the 2000s, winning a Grammy Award for best traditional pop vocal album in 2004.\nEarly Life and Career\nSinger-songwriter Rod Stewart was born Roderick David Stewart on January 10, 1945, in London, England. Born into a working-class family, Stewart excelled at soccer. He worked a series of odd jobs, including working as a grave digger, before his singing career took off.\nDuring the 1960s, Stewart was a part of several different bands. In 1966, he joined the blues-influenced Jeff Beck Group and experienced his first taste of success. The group toured the United Kingdom and the United States and released two hit albums. In 1969, he joined what became known as the Faces. Ron Wood was one of his bandmates and became a member of the Rolling Stones. Stewart also performed as a solo artist and scored his first big solo success with the album Every Picture Tells A Story, which featured the hit single \"Maggie May\" in 1971. That same year, the Faces had a hit with the song \"Stay With Me.\"\nCareer Highlights\nStewart moved to the United States in 1975. The next year, he reached the top of the U.S. charts with \"Tonight's the Night\" from\u00a0A Night on the Town. Stewart continued to have a slicker, more pop sound as the decade progressed. He also developed a reputation for his partying lifestyle and for dating numerous actresses and models. With 1978's\u00a0Blondes Have More Fun, he had another smash hit single with \"Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?\"\nThe 1980s proved to be more challenging for Stewart. While 1981's\u00a0Tonight I'm Yours\u00a0went platinum, the albums that followed did not fare as well. He ended the decade on a positive note, however. His remake of the Tom Waits song \"Downtown Train\" in 1989 received a lot of radio play. A few years later, he released\u00a0Unplugged and Seated\u00a0(1993), which was recorded at MTV Unplugged concert and featured the hit \"Have I Told You Lately.\"\nWith his distinctive throaty, almost scratchy-sounding voice, Stewart decided to take on some of the classic songs and make them his own with\u00a0It Had to be You: The Great American Songbook\u00a0(2002). He recorded four volumes of the\u00a0Great American Songbook\u00a0series, and won his first Grammy Award (best traditional pop vocal album) for\u00a0Stardust: The Great American Songbook, Volume III\u00a0in 2004.\nLater Years\nAt the age of 60, Stewart became a father for seventh time. His son, Alastair Wallace Stewart, was born on November 27, 2005. This was his first child with then fianc\u00e9e Penny Lancaster. The couple married in 2007 and welcomed a second son, Aiden, in 2011. He also has a daughter, Kimberly, and a son, Sean, from his first wife Alana Stewart and a daughter named Ruby with former girlfriend Kelly Emberg. He also has two children from his marriage to model Rachel Hunter\u2014Renee and Liam. Stewart publicly acknowledged his oldest daughter, Sarah Streeter, in 2013. Streeter was born when Stewart was only 18 years old, and he and the girl's mother had decided to put their baby up for adoption. Stewart and Streeter first met in 2008.\nIn 2006, Stewart returned to rock music with\u00a0Still The Same: Great Rock Classics of Our Time. The album reached the top of the pop charts in October of that year. Stewart put down the microphone and picked up a pen to write his 2012 memoir Rod: The Autobiography. The following year, he made an impressive return to songwriting with his album Time. Stewart co-wrote of many of the record's songs as well as serving as a co-producer on the project.\nFact Check\nWe strive for accuracy and fairness.

{"context": "\nSiegfried & Roy\nSiegfried & Roy, consisting of Siegfried Fischbacher and Roy Horn (born Uwe Ludwig Horn) are a German-American duo of former stage magicians and entertainers who became known for their appearances with white lions and white tigers.\n\nFrom 1990 until Roy's severe onstage injury ended their stage careers on October 3, 2003, the duo formed Siegfried & Roy at the Mirage Resort and Casino, which was regarded as the most-visited show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Roy's injury has generally been reported as an attack by a tiger involved in the show, although the two magicians have disputed that account \u2013 saying instead that he suffered a stroke and that any injury by the tiger was secondary and accidental. The duo staged a brief comeback performance in 2010 before leaving show business for good. They now run a menagerie at the Mirage Hotel in Las Vegas.\n\nSiegfried \n\nSiegfried Fischbacher was born in Rosenheim, Germany on June 13, 1939 to Maria and Martin Fischbacher.  Siegfried's mother was a housewife and his father was a professional painter who was imprisoned by the Soviets during World War II. Siegfried purchased a magic book as a child and began practising tricks. Siegfried moved to Italy in 1956, and began working at a hotel.  He eventually found work performing magic on the ship the TS Bremen under the stage name Delmare. Siegfried and Roy met while Siegfried was performing aboard the ship and asked Roy to assist him during a show.  Siegfried and Roy were fired from the TS Bremen for bringing a live cheetah onto the ship, but were scouted by a New York-based cruise line and began performing together as a duo. \n\nRoy \n\nRoy Horn was born Uwe Ludwig Horn on October 3, 1944 in Nordenham, in the midst of bomb attacks, to Johanna Horn. His biological father fought on the Russian front, and his father and mother divorced after the war ended. Roy's mother remarried a construction worker, and later began work in a factory. Roy had three brothers: Manfred, Alfred, and Werner. Roy became interested in animals at a very young age, and cared for his childhood dog, named Hexe. Roy's mother's friend's husband, Emil, was founder of the Bremen zoo, which gave Roy access to exotic animals from the age of ten.  Roy visited the United States briefly when his ship wrecked and was towed to New York City, and returned home to Bremen before returning to the sea as a waiter, where he met Siegfried and launched his performance career.\n\nCareer\n\nThe owner of the Astoria Theatre in Bremen, Germany saw Siegfried and Roy's act aboard a Caribbean cruise ship and recruited the duo to perform at her nightclub. This launched a career on the European nightclub circuit, and the duo began to perform with tigers. They were discovered performing in Paris by Tony Azzie, who asked them to come to Las Vegas in 1967. They spent some time in Puerto Rico, and may have purchased property there. \n\nIn 1981, Ken Feld, of Mattel's Feld Productions started the Beyond Belief show starring Siegfried & Roy at the New Frontier Hotel and Casino. Irvin Feld purchased Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey Circus in 1982.  In late 1988, Beyond Belief Las Vegas act went on an international tour to Japan then to Radio City ending in 1989. The show returned to Las Vegas in 1990, this time at the Mirage Hotel until the October 2003 accident.\n\nIn 2004, their act became the basis for the short-lived television series Father of the Pride. Right before its release, the series was almost cancelled until Siegfried & Roy urged NBC to continue production after Roy's injury from October 2003 improved.\n\nHorn's injury\n\nOn October 3, 2003, during a show at the Mirage, Roy was apparently bitten in the neck by a 7-year-old male white tiger named Mantecore (but often referred to as Montecore ).  Crew members separated Roy from the tiger and rushed him to University Medical Center. Roy was critically injured and sustained severe blood loss.  Siegfried and Roy have strongly disagreed with the reports that said Roy was attacked by the tiger \u2013 saying instead that he had suffered a stroke while on stage and Mantecore responded by picking him up and moving him out of the way to try to protect him, accidentally severing his artery in the process. While being taken to the hospital, Roy said \"Montecore is a great cat. Make sure no harm comes to Montecore.\" \n\nPartially paralyzed, by 2006, Roy was talking and walking (with assistance from Fischbacher), although he has not yet gained use of his left side. On Pat O'Brien's television news program The Insider, he commented about his daily rehabilitation, \"They are slave drivers over there. You'd think they are the KGB from Russia.\" \n\nThe injury to Roy prompted the Mirage to close the show, and 267 cast and crew members were laid off. \n\nIn February 2009, the duo staged a final appearance with Mantecore as a benefit for the Lou Ruvo Brain Institute. This performance was recorded for broadcast on ABC television's 20/20 program. \n\nOn April 23, 2010, Siegfried & Roy retired from show business. \"The last time we closed, we didn\u2019t have a lot of warning,\" said longtime manager Bernie Yuman. \"This is farewell. This is the dot at the end of the sentence.\" \n\nMantecore died on March 19, 2014 at the age of 17 after a short illness.\n\nFilmography\n\n* Bassie & Adriaan: De reis vol verrassingen (children's TV series; 1994)\n* Casino (1995)\n* Siegfried & Roy: Masters of the Impossible (1996)  \n* Vegas Vacation (1997)\n* Siegfried & Roy: The Magic Box (1999)\n* Ocean's Eleven (2001)\n* Showboy (2002)\n", "context_len": 1100, "questions": ["What is the last name of the performer mauled by Montacore, one of his very special white tigers, in Las Vegas on October 3, 2003?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Spiced Rum", "Spiced rum", "Rum", "Gunpowder Rum", "Rum (beverage)", "White rum", "Jamaica Spirits", "Ca\u00f1a blanca", "Dark rum", "White Rum", "Cuban rum", "Jamaica Spirit", "Gold rum", "Cane spirit", "Light rum", "Black rum", "Rude rum", "Hard rum", "Overproof rum", "Coconut rum"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nFour-minute mile\nIn the sport of athletics, the four-minute mile means completing the mile run (1,760 yards, or 1,609.344 metres) in less than four minutes. It was first achieved in 1954 by Roger Bannister in 3:59.4.  The \"four-minute barrier\" has since been broken by many male athletes, and is now the standard of all male professional middle distance runners. In the last 50 years the mile record has been lowered by almost 17 seconds.  Running a mile in four minutes translates to a speed of 15 miles per hour (24.14\u00a0km/h, or 2:29.13 per kilometre, or 14.91 seconds per 100 metres).\n\nRecord holders\n\nBreaking the four-minute barrier was first achieved on 6 May 1954 at Oxford University's Iffley Road Track, by Englishman Roger Bannister,  with the help of fellow-runners as pacemakers.    Two months later, during the 1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games hosted in Vancouver, B.C., two competing runners, Australia's John Landy and Bannister, ran the distance of one mile in under four minutes. The race's end is memorialised in a statue of the two (with Landy glancing over his shoulder, thus losing the race) placed in front of the Pacific National Exhibition entrance plaza.\n\nNew Zealand's John Walker, the first man to run the mile under 3:50, managed to run 135 sub-four-minute miles during his career (during which he was the first person to run over 100 sub-four-minute miles), and American Steve Scott has run the most sub-four-minute miles, with 136. Algeria's Noureddine Morceli was the first under 3:45.  Currently, the mile record is held by Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj, who ran a time of 3:43.13 in Rome in 1999.\n\nIn 1964, America's Jim Ryun became the first high-school runner to break four minutes for the mile, running 3:59.0 as a junior and a then American record 3:55.3 as a senior in 1965.  Tim Danielson (1966) and Marty Liquori (1967) also came in under four minutes, but Ryun's high-school record stood until Alan Webb ran 3:53.43 in 2001.  Ten years later, in 2011, Lukas Verzbicas became the fifth high-schooler under four minutes.   In 2015, Matthew Maton and Grant Fisher became the sixth and seventh high-schoolers to break four minutes, both running 3:59.38 about a month apart.   Webb was the first high schooler to run sub-4 indoors, running 3:59.86 in early 2001.  On February 6, 2016, Andrew Hunter significantly improved upon Webb's mark, running 3:58.25 on the same New York Armory track  and 3:57.81 two weeks later.   Hunter achieved the 4 minute mile mark outdoors later in the season at the Prefontaine Classic.  At that same meet Michael Slagowski joined the list of high school athletes under 4 minutes. \n\nAnother illustration of the progression of performance in the men's mile is that, in 1994, forty years after Bannister's breaking of the barrier, the Irish runner Eamonn Coghlan became the first man over the age of 40 to run a sub-four-minute mile.  Because Coghlan surpassed the mark indoors and before the IAAF validated indoor performances as being eligible for outdoor records, World Masters Athletics still had not recognised a sub-4-minute-mile performance as a record in the M40 division. Many elite athletes made the attempts to extend their careers beyond age 40 to challenge that mark. Over 18 years after Coghlan, that was finally achieved by UK's Anthony Whiteman, running 3:58.79 on 2 June 2012. \n\nNo woman has yet run a four-minute mile. , the women's world record is held by retired Russian Svetlana Masterkova, with a time of 4:12.56 in 1996. \n\nIn 1997, Daniel Komen of Kenya ran two miles in less than eight minutes, doubling up on Bannister's accomplishment.   He did it again in February 1998, falling just .3 behind his previous performance, still the only individual to accomplish the feat. \n\nPossible other claims \n\nJames Parrott\n\nSome sources (including Olympic medalist Peter Radford ) contend the first successful four-minute mile was run in London by James Parrott on 9 May 1770.   Parrott's route began on Goswell Road, before turning down Old Street, finishing at St Leonard's, Shoreditch. Although timing methods at this time were \u2013 following the invention of the chronometer by John Harrison \u2013 accurate enough to measure the four minutes correctly the record is not recognised by modern sporting bodies.  Neal Bascomb notes in The Perfect Mile that \"even nineteenth-century historians cast a skeptical eye on the account.\" \n\nGlenn Cunningham\n\nIt is also reputed that Glenn Cunningham achieved a four-minute mile in a workout in the 1920s. In addition to being unsubstantiated, a workout run would not count as a record. \n\nPopular culture\n\nIn 1988, the ABC and the BBC co-produced The Four Minute Mile, a miniseries dramatisation of the race to the four-minute mile, featuring Richard Huw as Bannister and Nique Needles as John Landy (who was simultaneously pursuing the milestone). It was written by David Williamson and directed by Jim Goddard.\n\nIn 2004, Neal Bascomb wrote a book entitled The Perfect Mile about Roger Bannister, John Landy, and Wes Santee portraying their individual attempts to break the four-minute mile and the context of the sport of mile racing. A second film version (entitled Four Minutes) was made in 2005, starring Jamie Maclachlan as Bannister.\n\nIn June 2011 the watch used to time the original event was donated by Jeffrey Archer to a charity auction for Oxford University Athletics Club and sold for \u00a397,250. \n\nIn July 2016 the BBC released a documentary with firsthand interviews from Bannister and various other figures on the first sub-4 minute mile.\n", "context_len": 1038, "questions": ["Who is popularly recognised as being the first person to run a mile in under 4 minutes?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Lemuroid", "Lemuriens", "LEMURS", "Lemur", "Lemuroidea", "Lemurs", "Lemurs of Madagascar"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

The character was portrayed by Ursula Andress and was voiced by Nikki van der Zyl .\nContents\n[ show ]\nFilm biography\nHaving drawn a link between the murder of British spy John Strangways and radioactive samples he had taken from an island named Crab Key (owned by the reclusive Dr. Julius No ) Bond convinces a reluctant Quarrel to take him there by boat. There Bond meets the beautiful Honey Ryder, dressed only in a white bikini, who is collecting shells. She emerges from the sea, singing. At first she is suspicious of Bond but soon decides to help him after the island's guards destroy her boat. Bond and Quarrel follow her to a hiding place inland. After nightfall they are attacked by the legendary \" dragon \" of Crab Key, which turns out to be an armoured tractor equipped with a flamethrower. In the resulting gun battle, Quarrel is incinerated whilst Bond and Ryder are taken prisoner. They are decontaminated, quartered in Dr. No's lair, and given drugged coffee to render them unconscious. They dress and meet Dr. No in his office, where he invites them to lunch. After dinner, Ryder is taken away and Bond is beaten by the guards. Later, after killing Dr. No and sabotaging the island's reactor, Bond rescues Honey from being slowly drowned. As the complex explodes, the pair escape by boat until they run out of gas in the middle of the sea, and start kissing.\nBehind the scenes\nAs \"The Original Bond Girl\"\nHoney Ryder emerges from the sea in an iconic scene from Dr. No (1962).\nIn the film series, Ryder is widely regarded as the first Bond girl , although she is not the first woman in the film to be with Bond (that distinction belongs to Sylvia Trench , while Miss Taro was Bond's first mission-related \"conquest\"). Her entrance in the film, emerging from the ocean in a white bikini, striding barefoot over the wet beach sand, with a large sea shell in one hand and a hunting knife in the other, while the sun shines on her wet blonde hair, is considered a classic James Bond moment and is one of the most popular scenes in cinematic history. As a homage, Halle Berry performed a similar scene in an orange bikini in the 20th James Bond film, Die Another Day . Mariah Carey also references this scene in the music video for her song \"Honey\".\nThe character was later mentioned by name in On Her Majesty's Secret Service as a \"beautiful movie star.\" Andress is the first of only two entertainers that have actually starred in a Bond film to be mentioned by Fleming in his James Bond novels. The other is David Niven who co-starred as James Bond in the 1967 film adaptation of Casino Royale along with Andress.\nOmitted scenes\nStill photograph of the original crab torture scene in Dr. No.\nThe 1958 James Bond novel Dr. No by Ian Fleming, Crab Key is named after the thousands of large land crabs \u2013 what they call in Jamaica \"black crabs\" \u2013 which infest the island. The book features a scene where Dr. No plans to torture Honey to death by tying her naked to the ground in the path of the crabs' migration; mistakenly believing that the animals are carnivorous from the death of an earlier victim. A similar scene was initially replicated for the 1962 film with Honey being tortured by being tied to the ground along with crabs, but since the crabs were sent frozen from the Caribbean, they did not move much during filming, so the scene was altered to have Honey slowly drowning.

{"context": "\nWawel Castle\nThe Wawel Castle is a castle residency built at the behest of King Casimir III the Great, who reigned from 1333 to 1370, and consists of a number of structures situated around the central courtyard.\n\nIn the 14th century it was rebuilt by Jogaila and Jadwiga of Poland. Their reign saw the addition of the tower called the Hen's Foot (Kurza Stopka) and the Danish Tower.  The Jadwiga and Jogaila Chamber, in which the sword Szczerbiec, was used in coronation ceremonies, is exhibited today and is another remnant of this period. Other structures were developed on the hill during that time as well, in order to serve as quarters for the numerous clergy, royal clerks and craftsmen. Defensive walls and towers such as Jordanka, Lubranka, Sandomierska, T\u0119czy\u0144ska, Szlachecka, Z\u0142odziejska and Panie\u0144ska were erected in the same period.\n\nThe Wawel Royal Castle and the Wawel Hill constitute the most historically and culturally important site in Poland. For centuries the residence of the kings of Poland and the symbol of Polish statehood, the Castle is now one of the country\u2019s premier art museums. Established in 1930, the museum encompasses ten curatorial departments responsible for collections of paintings, including an important collection of Italian Renaissance paintings, prints, sculpture, textiles, among them the Sigismund II Augustus tapestry collection, goldsmith\u2019s work, arms and armor, ceramics, Meissen porcelain, and period furniture. The museum\u2019s holdings in oriental art include the largest collection of Ottoman tents in Europe. With seven specialized conservation studios, the museum is also an important center for the conservation of works of art.\n\nHistory \n\nPeople have lived on Wawel Hill at the site of the Castle as early as fifty thousand years ago, in the Paleolithic Age. The settlement was apparently bustling with trade, assorted crafts and local farming. When more people began to settle down on the Wawel Hill and when trade became more efficient, the rulers of Poland took up their residence at the Hill as well.\n\nDuring the early 16th century King Sigismund I the Old (Zygmunt I in Polish) and his wife brought in the best native and foreign artists including Italian architects, sculptors, and German decorators, to refurbish the castle into a splendid Renaissance palace.  It soon became a paragon of stately residence in Central and Eastern Europe and served widely as a model throughout the region.\n\nIn the fire of 1595, the northeast part of the castle burned down.  King Sigismund III Vasa rebuilt it, although of his efforts only the Senator Stairs and the fireplace in the Bird Room remain today. In 1609 King Sigismund moved the capital to Warsaw, and tough times for Wawel began. Both the castle and other buildings were neglected despite the concerns of local governors. The Swedish invasions of 1655\u20131657 and 1702 contributed to the further deterioration of the castle.  \n\nThe Hill was occupied by the Prussian Army in 1794. Royal Insignia were stolen and never retrieved (apart from the Szczerbiec).  After the Third Partition of Poland (1795) Wawel, as an important defensive point, was mostly demolished and the remaining part was modernised by Austrians with defensive walls. The interior of the castle was changed and some of the buildings pulled down. In the second part of the 19th century the Austrians redesigned the defensive walls making them a part of a stronghold. However, in 1905 the emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria gave an order for Austrian troops to leave Wawel. Restoration works began, with the discovery of the Rotunda of Virgin Mary as well as other relics of the past. The renovations of the Wawel Hill were financed by public subscriptions.\n\nAfter World War I, the authorities of the newly independent Polish Second Republic decided that Wawel Castle was to become a representative building of the Polish state and would be used by the Governor and later by the President himself. In 1921 the Polish Parliament passed a resolution which gave Wawel official status as the residence of the President of Poland. Following the ravages of World War II, by the decree of the State National Council, Wawel Castle became a national museum.\n\nCrown Treasury and armory \n\nThe Crown Treasury situated in the historic Gothic rooms which were used from the 15th century on for storing the Polish coronation insignia and Crown Jewels, feature on display priceless objects from the former Treasury that survived plunder, among them the memorabilia of Polish monarchs including members of their families and eminent personages, like the hat and sword given to John III Sobieski by the pope after the Battle of Vienna, as well as the coronation sword Szczerbiec.\n\nChambers \n\n* State Rooms\n* Royal Private Apartments\n* Exhibition \"The Lost Wawel\"\n* Exhibition \"Oriental Art\"\n* The Royal Gardens\n* Dragon's Den\n\nFragment in Chicago \n\nA column fragment of Wawel Castle has been incorporated into Chicago's landmark Tribune Tower. Located in its own niche over the upper-left corner of the main entrance, it is a visual tribute to Chicago's large Polish populace, the largest such presence outside of the Republic of Poland.\n\nGallery \n\nFile:Wawel end 16th cent.jpg|A woodcut of Wawel Castle in 1617.\nFile:Wawel z mostu Debnickiego (2007).jpg|The castle seen from the D\u0119bnicki Bridge. \nFile:Krakau - Wawel-Weichsel-Panorama.JPG|Panorama of the Wawel Complex\nImage:Krakow Wawel 20070804 0930.jpg|Sigismund III Vasa Tower (1595) and defensive walls.\nImage:Saint Leonardo vault.PNG|St. Leonard's Crypt under the Wawel Castle.\nFile:Wawel Royal Castle Krakow Poland by blaat.jpg | Wawel Royal Castle from the Vistulan Boulevards. \nImage:Rotunda sw.

The song became another worldwide hit for the group, and was included on the Sliding Doors soundtrack.\n\nComposition\n\nThe song possessed less of a \"bubble pop\" sound than their other releases. The song was slow-paced and showed the full range of Lene Nystr\u00f8m Rasted's vocals, while maintaining the Aqua sound. The song samples the Pet Shop Boys' single, \"Heart\". \n\nRelease\n\nThe song featured on the soundtrack for the 1998 film Sliding Doors, and was released across the world the same year. In Japan, \"Turn Back Time\" was released along with \"My Oh My\". The song subsequently gained far more radio airplay than their other releases.\n\nCommercial performance\n\nThe single is their third number one single in the United Kingdom. On its May 1998 UK release, the song topped the charts for one week, making Aqua one of the few groups to have their first three singles all make number one. This single reached #18 on Billboards Top 40 Mainstream chart and therefore was their second highest charting hit in the United States.\n\nMusic video\n\nThe video for the release contained footage from Sliding Doors (1998), and was therefore very different from the previous, comedy videos by the group.

{"context": "\nGive Us a Clue\nGive Us a Clue is a British televised game show version of charades which was broadcast on ITV from 1979 to 1992. The original host was Michael Aspel from 1979 to 1984, followed by Michael Parkinson from 1984 to 1992. The show featured two teams, one captained by Lionel Blair and the other by Una Stubbs. Later versions of the programme had Liza Goddard as captain of the women's team.\n\nA revived version was attempted by BBC One, which ran from 10 November to 19 December 1997 and commissioned 30 episodes, it was hosted by Tim Clark. Teams were captained by Christopher Blake and Julie Peasgood and the show tried to introduce a lateral thinking puzzle (which the host could \"give clues to\"). Give us a Clue returned for a special Comic Relief episode on 5 March 2011 with Sara Cox, Christopher Biggins, Lionel Blair, Una Stubbs, Holly Walsh, Jenni Falconer and David Walliams.\n\nFormat\n\nThe game was based on charades, a party game where players used mime rather than speaking to demonstrate a name, phrase, book, play, film or TV programme. Each player was given roughly two minutes to act out their given subject in front of his/her team, and if the others were unsuccessful in guessing correctly, the opposing team would have a chance to answer for a bonus point.\n\nTransmissions\n\nSeries 1 was not networked, Thames and a few other broadcast the series, around 19:00 while most others station moved it to an early time slot including 15:50. By 1980 all station were broadcasting the series in peaktime slot until 1986. No series was made in 1987 but repeats were broadcast on certain ITV station usually around 17:15.\n\nIn 1988 the show moved to an early morning slot, left vacant when ITV Schools relocated to Channel 4, before being moved once again to around 15:00 slot in 1989 onwards. The original run ended in 1991, but a one-off special was broadcast on 4 May 1992.\n\nTheme music\n\nThe original theme tune was called \"Chicken Man\", which was also the theme tune of Grange Hill. However, while Grange Hill used the original recording, Give us a Clue used a less dynamic custom arrangement more in keeping with the style of light entertainment programming. In 1981, David Clark took over as producer/director and commissioned an entirely new theme tune, then in 1987, a new vocalised theme tune was used up until the show ended in 1992.\n\nTrivia\n\nThe programme has been repeated on satellite TV and is also still parodied in British comedy. It was frequently referred to by Humphrey Lyttelton, chairman of BBC radio's long-running \"antidote to panel games\", I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue, during a round of Sound Charades \u2014 usually with a gay innuendo-laden gag at the expense of Lionel Blair.\n\nOther versions\n\nA licensed version of it aired in New Zealand in the 1990s, after the British original had screened there for several seasons.

{"context": "\nQuarter days\nIn British and Irish tradition, the quarter days were the four dates in each year on which servants were hired, school terms started, and rents were due. They fell on four religious festivals roughly three months apart and close to the two solstices and two equinoxes.\n\nThe significance of quarter days is now limited, although leasehold payments and rents for land and premises in England are often still due on the old English quarter days.\n\nThe quarter days have been observed at least since the Middle Ages, and they ensured that debts and unresolved lawsuits were not allowed to linger on. Accounts had to be settled, a reckoning had to be made and publicly recorded on the quarter days. \n\nIn England\n\nThe English quarter days (also observed in Wales and the Channel Islands) are\n* Lady Day (25 March)\n* Midsummer Day (24 June)\n* Michaelmas (29 September)\n* Christmas (25 December)\n\nLady Day was also the first day of the year in British dominions (excluding Scotland) until 1752 (when it was harmonised with the Scottish practice of 1 January being New Year's Day). The British tax year still starts on \"Old\" Lady Day (6 April under the Gregorian calendar corresponded to 25 March under the Julian calendar: 11 days new-style calendar advance in 18th century plus 1 day due to the twelfth skipped Julian leap day in 1800; however it was not changed to 7 April when a thirteenth Julian leap day was skipped in 1900). The dates of the Quarter Days observed in northern England until the 18th century were the same as those in Scotland.Fitton, Mike (1994) [http://www.mpsgg.com/WDIM/WDIM_06.html Quarter Days and Courts]\n\nThe cross-quarter days are four holidays falling in between the quarter days: Candlemas (2 February), May Day (1 May), Lammas (1 August), and All Hallows (1 November). The Scottish term days, which fulfil a similar role as days on which rents are paid, correspond more nearly to the cross-quarter days than to the English quarter days.\n\nThere is a mnemonic for remembering on which day of the month the first three quarter days fall (Christmas being easy to recall): Every quarter day is twenty-something, and the second digit of the day of the month is the number of letters in the month's name. So March has five letters and Lady Day is 25 March; similarly June has four letters and September nine, with Midsummer Day and Michaelmas falling on the 24th and 29th respectively.\n\nAt many schools, class terms would begin on the Quarter days; for example, the autumn term would start on September 29, and thus continues to be called the Michaelmas term, especially at more traditional universities. \n\nIn Ireland\n\nPrior to the Christianization of Ireland in the 5th century AD, the Celtic quarter days were observed:\n\n*Lughnasadh (1 August)\n*Samhain (1 November)\n*Imbolc (1 February)\n*Beltaine (1 May)\n\nThese are now called cross-quarter days since they fall about halfway into each of the English quarters.\n\nIn Scotland\n\nThe \"Old Scottish term days\" corresponded approximately to the old Celtic quarter days:\n* Candlemas (2 February)\n* Whitsunday (legislatively fixed for this purpose on 15 May)\n* Lammas (1 August)\n* Martinmas (11 November).\n\nThese were also the dates of the Quarter Days observed in northern England until the 18th century.\n\nThe dates for removals and for the employment of servants of Whitsunday and Martinmas were changed in 1886 to 28 May and 28 November respectively.  The Term & Quarter Days (Scotland) Act 1990 redefined the \"Scottish term days\", in official use, as the 28th of February, May, August and November respectively. The Act specifies that the new dates take effect on 13 June 1991 (12 months from the date it was passed).\n", "context_len": 733, "questions": ["The quarter day Michaelmas occurs on which date of the year?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["ISO 3166-1:PG", "Papua Niu Gini", "New Guinea Papua", "Independent State of Papua New Guinea", "Health in Papua New Guinea", "Papa New Guinea", "Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guinee", "Papua-New-Guinea", "Independen Stet bilong Papua Niugini", "Papua New Guinea", "Papua-new guinea", "State of Papua New Guinea", "Papua Niugini", "Niugini", "Papa New Guinans", "Environment of Papua New Guinea", "PapuaNewGuineA", "Papua New Guinean", "Papau New Guinea", "Papa new guinea", "Niu Gini", "Paupa New Guinea", "East Papua", "Pappa New Guinans", "Pua pua new guniea", "Papua, New Guinea", "Pappa New Guinea", "The Papua New Guinea", "Papua new guinea", "Papua-New Guinea", "Papua New-Guinea", "Papua NG"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

The duo won 50 doubles titles together, including four at Wimbledon (1979, 1981, 1983 and 1984), and three at the US Open (1979, 1981 and 1983). Fleming once said that \"The best doubles pair in the world is John McEnroe and anyone\". \n\nFleming also played on three American Davis Cup winning teams (1979, 1981 and 1982), and helped the US win the World Team Cup twice (1984 and 1985).  Fleming reached the World No. 1 doubles ranking in 1984. His career-high singles ranking was World No. 8 in 1980, the year in which he reached the quarter-finals at the Wimbledon championships. Over the course of his career Fleming won three top-level singles titles and sixty doubles titles.  Prior to turning professional, Fleming played tennis for the University of California, Los Angeles (after transferring from the University of Michigan), and won the National Collegiate Athletic Association doubles title in 1976.\n\nSince retiring as a player, Fleming has become a tennis commentator for Sky Sports, Eurosport  and the BBC. \n\nFleming is a keen golfer (handicap 10) and is an active member of The Stage Golf Society.\n\nHe was inducted into the Intercollegiate Tennis Association (ITA) Hall of Fame.

{"context": "\nVelcro\nVelcro Companies is a privately held company that produces a series of mechanical based fastening products, including fabric hook and loop fasteners, under the brand name \"Velcro\".\n\nHistory\n\nThe first touch fasteners were developed by  Swiss electrical engineer George de Mestral who in 1941 went for a walk in the woods and wondered if the burrs that clung to his trousers \u2014 and dog \u2014 could be turned into something useful. \n\nThe original patented hook and loop fastener was invented in 1948 by de Mestral, who patented it in 1955 and subsequently refined and developed its practical manufacture until its commercial introduction in the late 1950s.\n\nDe Mestral developed a fastener that consisted of two components: a lineal fabric strip with tiny hooks that could \"mate\" with another fabric strip with smaller loops, attaching temporarily, until pulled apart.  Initially made of cotton, which proved impractical,  the fastener was eventually constructed with nylon and polyester. \n\nDe Mestral gave the name Velcro, a portmanteau of the French words velours (\"velvet\"), and crochet (\"hook\"),   to his invention as well as his company, which continues to manufacture and market the fastening system.\n\nHumphrey Cripps began investing in Velcro in the 1960s. In 2009, the company was taken private by a private equity firm linked to the Cripps family.  \n\nPatents and trademarks\n\nIn 1958, de Mestral filed for a patent application for his hook-and-loop fastener in Switzerland, which was granted in 1961. De Mestral\u2019s original patent expired in 1978, and competitors began to enter the market. The company frequently uses the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) system for international filings, and as of late 2010 has filed 134 PCT applications.\n\nVelcro Companies has relied on its Velcro trademark to build a brand name since the original patent expired. The term Velcro is a registered trademark of Velcro Industries B.V. Velcro Companies also owns trademark registrations for many of its other brands.\n\nTo reduce the risk of the Velcro name becoming a generic term and thereby losing the distinctiveness necessary to maintain its trademark protection, the company claims that there is no such thing as \u201cVelcro,\u201d and that the term is a company name, a brand and a trademark, not a generic term for a type of product. This is despite the fact that de Mestral himself gave the name Velcro to his invention rather than the company. Additionally the former director of industrial Sales for Velcro USA said \"Velcro is a series of hooks and loops, a male and female, one grabs the other and sticks.\"  Many dictionaries define Velcro as being a type of fastener, but generally note that the term is a protected trademark or proprietary name.  Through advertisements, product literature and marketing campaigns the company informs consumers that not all hook and loop fasteners are Velcro brand products.\n\nProducts\n\nVelcro make fastening products for a wide array of industries, including consumer packaged goods, transportation, personal care, military, packaging, construction, apparel, and agriculture.\n\nProducts of Velcro Companies include:\n* General Purpose adhesive backed fasteners\n* Ties and Straps\n* Heavy Duty Fasteners \n* Fabric Tapes and Fasteners \n* Traditional Hook-and-Loop fasteners\n* Woven, knit and molded products \n* Kid\u2019s Construction Sets\n\nCauses\n\nThe Neeson Cripps Academy, a high performance school for the Cambodian Children\u2019s Fund (CCF) in Phnom Penh was funded by Velcro Companies. New York City-based COOKFOX Architects designed the eco-efficient building, which is scheduled for completion in 2017.  \n\nIn 2015, Velcro Companies and Velcro Brand Ambassador and design expert Sabrina Soto launched an annual Classroom Makeover contest that takes place during Teacher Appreciation Week. The first winner from Joplin, Missouri received two redesigned classrooms.\n\nIn popular culture\n\n* 1968 - Velcro brand fasteners are used on the suits, sample collection bags, and lunar vehicles brought to the moon by Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.\n* 1984 - David Letterman wears a suit made of Velcro brand fasteners and jumps from a trampoline into a wall covered in the product during an interview with the company\u2019s USA director of industrial sales.\n* 2012 - Shoes with Velcro fasteners feature in the song \"Thrift Shop\" by Macklemore & Ryan Lewis. quote: \"I could take some Pro Wings, make them cool, sell those. The sneaker heads would be like \"Aw, he got the Velcros\"\"  \n* 2016 - As an April Fool's Day joke Lexus introduces \u201cVariable Load Coupling Rear Orientation (V-LCRO)\u201d seats, technology that attaches the driver to the seat with Velcro brand adhesive to allow for more aggressive turns.\n", "context_len": 859, "questions": ["In which decade did Swiss engineer George de Mestral obtain a patent for Velcro?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Manchester developments", "Manchester (borough)", "UN/LOCODE:GBMNC", "Manchester, Greater Manchester", "Manchester, UK", "Climate of Manchester", "City of Manchester", "The weather in Manchester", "Manchester (city, England)", "Machester", "Drizzlechester", "Mancs", "Manchester", "Manchester, United Kingdom", "Manchester (England)", "Metropolitan Borough of Manchester", "Manchester, U.K.", "Manchester (UK)", "England Manchester", "Manchester, England", "County Borough of Manchester"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nLacryma Christi\nLacryma Christi, (also Lachryma Christi of Vesuvius, literally \"tears of Christ\"), is the name of a celebrated Neapolitan type of wine produced on the slopes of Mount Vesuvius in Campania, Italy. White Lacryma Christi is made mainly from Verdeca and Coda di Volpe grapes, with smaller proportions of Falanghina, Caprettone  and Greco di Tufo included. Red Lacryma Christi is made from Piedirosso and Sciascinoso grapes. It is also, as archaeologists have discovered, the nearest equivalent to wine drunk by the Ancient Romans, having analysed microscopic residue left on the taps of the casks. \n\nOrigins of name\n\nThe name Lacryma Christi comes from an old myth that Christ, crying over Lucifer's fall from heaven, cried his tears on the land and gave divine inspiration to the vines that grew there. The sides of Vesuvius are deeply scarred by past lava flows, and its lower slopes are extremely fertile, dotted with villages and covered with vineyards.\n\nLacryma Christi in literature and media\n\nLacryma Christi is an old wine, frequently mentioned by poets and writers. Lacryma Christi was mentioned in the book by Alexandre Dumas, The Count of Monte Cristo, in W. J. Turner's poem Talking with Soldiers, in Candide by Voltaire, and by Christopher Marlowe in his play Tamburlaine the Great, Part II. The Irish periodical writer and journalist William Maginn mentions the wine amongst other spirits in his poem \"Inishowen\" c. 1822. In the late work of the German novelist Theodor Fontane \"Der Stechlin\" (1898) the wine is mentioned  to be served after lunch in a convent and is characterized to be of higher grade than a Montefiascone. The Dutch novelist Harry Mulisch mentions the wine together with the island of Capri in his 1987 novel \"The Pupil\". In the short story \"Rappaccini's Daughter\" collected in Mosses from an Old Manse and Other Stories by Nathaniel Hawthorne, a glass of lachryma is drunk by the protagonist \"which caused his brain to swim with strange fantasies\". \n\nIn the 1954 movie, Three Coins in the Fountain, Lacryma Christi is mentioned as being the favorite wine of Prince Dino di Cessi, played by actor Louis Jourdan.\n\nJean Paul Didierlaurent mentions the wine in his novel \"The reader on the 6.27\" (2014), \"(...) getting drunk on Christ's tears was the best thing that could happen to a Christian.\"\n", "context_len": 451, "questions": ["Lachryma Christi, an old Italian sweet red wine translates to mean 'whose what'?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0629", "Amorrhitis", "\u0633\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0627", "Sport in Syria", "Syrian Arab Republic", "Administrative divisions of Syria", "S\u016br\u012byah", "Arab Republic of Syria", "Assad government", "Assad regime", "Etymology of Syria", "Subdivisions of Syria", "\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0647\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0651\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0651\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0651\u0648\u0631\u064a\u0651\u0629", "S\u016briy\u0101", "ISO 3166-1:SY", "Assad Government", "Syria", "Northern Syria", "Syrie", "Syrien", "Souria", "Sourie", "Suriyah", "Syrian (language)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nValenki\nValenki (; sg valenok ()) are traditional Russian winter footwear, essentially felt boots: the name valenok literally means \"made by felting\". Valenki are made of wool felt. They are not water-resistant, and are often worn with galoshes to keep water out and protect the soles from wear and tear. Valenki were once the footwear of choice for many Russians, but in the second half of the 20th century they lost most of their appeal in cities, due to their association with rustic dress.\n\nValenki (synonymic and semantic related expressions which mean the same \u2013 v\u0430\u0301lenukhi (pl.), v\u0430\u0301lezhki, v\u0430\u0301leni, v\u0430\u0301lentsi, k\u0430\u0301tanki) \u2013 warm felted highboots made from dried sheep\u2019s wool; they are usually hard by their form, but there are soft types which are made for a corresponding footwear.\n\nValenki are a kind of traditional Russian footwear which is usually worn for walking on dry snow when the weather is frosty. Valenki wear out most quickly from the bottom and very often are soled with leather or other durable material to prevent this, so they are often worn with galoshes. Also, to protect from getting wet \u2013 they use a rubber sole, and there are valenki with glue-sew and molded soles. Traditionally, valenki come in brown, black, gray and white, but the last few years, consumers have been able to order these boots in a variety of colors (red, blue, purple, green, yellow, orange).\n\nValenki are included in standard of supplying officers and the ranks of the internal military service of the Russian army with warm clothes and gear. \n\nValenki stem from the traditional felt boots worn by nomads of the Great Steppe (including Southern Rus'), whose history goes back over 1500 years.\n\nHowever, as it\u2019s supposed, the boots appeared at the beginning of the 18th century.\nValenki became widespread only in the first half of the 19th century, when they started being manufactured by industrial methods. Before this, they were quite expensive and only wealthy people could afford to have them. The increasing complexity of needs, the growing influence of the urban mores to the village caused the change of bast shoes with felt boots, and with it, the broad development of fulling production.\n\nValenki became less popular in the urban life in recent decades because winters in Central Russia turned to be more soft and slushy, and as result \u2013 lighter and waterproof footwear gradually won popularity and replaced valenki. Valenki are associated with a traditional rustic style of clothing; in cities they are usually worn by little kids, or they are worn by one and all in a severe frost, when other shoes don\u2019t protect from the cold.\n\nBefore the revolution, the production of valenki was concentrated in the Semenov district of Nizhny Novgorod province, in the Kineshma District of Kostroma province, and in the Kukmor in Kazan province. In 1900, contemporary jackboot fulling factories of Russia produced 1.4 million pairs of valenki in the amount of 2.1 million rubles.  In 1900, a pair of valenki cost 1.5 rubles, in 1912 - 2 rubles, at the end of 1916 the speculative price reached up to 12-18 rubles per pair.\n", "context_len": 606, "questions": ["On which part of the body would Russian valenki normally be worn?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Nadine Elizabeth Louise Coyle", "Outta My Mind", "Nadine Coyle discography", "NADINE COYLE", "Girl On the Loose", "Nadine Coyle"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nThoughtcrime\nA thoughtcrime is an occurrence or instance of controversial or socially unacceptable thoughts. The term is also used to describe some theological concepts such as disbelief or idolatry,  or a rejection of strong philosophical or social principles. \n\nThe term was popularized in the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four by George Orwell, wherein thoughtcrime is the criminal act of holding unspoken beliefs or doubts that oppose or question the ruling party. In the book, the government attempts to control not only the speech and actions, but also the thoughts of its subjects. To entertain unacceptable thoughts is known as crimethink in Newspeak, the ideologically purified dialect of the party.  \"Crimestop\" is a way to avoid crimethink by immediately purging dangerous thoughts from the mind.\n\nSummary\n\nSome modern publishers have described people who were being prosecuted and burned at the stake for heresy in various Abrahamic religions, as being victims of thoughtcrime laws. Such victims of thoughtcrime laws would sometimes be offered the chance to repent for their thoughtcrimes. \n\nPeople were similarly executed, or imprisoned in concentration camps, for thoughtcrime during the 20th century in totalitarian regimes, such as Stalinist USSR, Maoist China, and Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge.\n\nThe word is also used in instances where people are prevented from voicing opinions which are politically incorrect or which others may potentially be offended by. This prevention may affect speech, writing, and other forms of expression. The punishment of apostasy in sharia law is sometimes interpreted as being the death penalty, which has been described as a thoughtcrime. \n\nNineteen Eighty-Four \n\nThe Thought Police (thinkpol in Newspeak) are the secret police of the novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. It is their job to uncover and punish thoughtcrime. The Thought Police use surveillance and psychological monitoring to find and eliminate members of society who challenge the party's authority and ideology. \n\nThe Thought Police of Orwell and their pursuit of thoughtcrime were based on the methods used by the totalitarian states and ideologies of the 20th century.\n\nThe term \"Thought Police\", by extension, has come to refer to real or perceived enforcement of ideological correctness.\n\nTechnology and thoughtcrime \n\nTechnology played a significant part in the detection of thoughtcrime in Nineteen Eighty-Four\u2014with the ubiquitous telescreens which could inform the government, misinform and monitor the population. The citizens of Oceania are watched by the Thought Police through the telescreens. Every movement, reflex, facial expression, and reaction is measured by this system, monitored by the Ministry of Love.\n\nAt times, it seems as if the telescreen is constantly watching each citizen. Winston Smith recognises that he has no idea who is behind the technology, watching him or anyone else.\n\nBecause of this system of surveillance, the Thought Police and the Ministry of Love become universally feared by any member of the Outer Party or any one of the 'Proles' who is capable (or felt by the Party to be capable) of thoughtcrime.\n\nCrimestop\n\n\"Crimestop\" means to rid oneself of unwanted thoughts immediately, i.e., thoughts that interfere or disagree with the ideology of the Party. This way, a person avoids committing thoughtcrime.\n\nIn the novel, we hear about crimestop through the eyes of protagonist Winston Smith:\n\nOrwell also describes crimestop from the perspective of Emmanuel Goldstein in the book The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism:\n", "context_len": 612, "questions": ["\"What famous novel invented the terms \"\"thoughtcrime\"\" and \"\"doubleplusgood\"\"?\""], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Strauss, Richard", "Richard Strauss", "Richard Georg Strauss", "Ricardo Strauss"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nVoting (Commons) - politics.co.uk - Homepage\nVoting (Commons)\nVoting (Commons)\nTweet\nCompared to other legislatures, voting in the Commons is perhaps the most archaic of its traditions. The chair puts a question to the House. If the chair cannot easily discern the opinion of the House ('on a general Aye'), then a vote is held.\nWhen a vote - or 'division' - is called MPs literally divide into two groups, those in favour (the Ayes) and those against (the Noes), by proceeding through one of two corridors (lobbies), where they are counted. When the chair calls a division (by saying 'clear the lobbies'), the division bells signalling a vote are sounded around the Palace of Westminster, in Whitehall and elsewhere. MPs have eight minutes to arrive in one of the two lobbies before the entrances are locked. They are counted as they exit. The quorum for a vote is 40.\nThe outcome of the vote is then reported to the chair by one of the four MPs (two for each lobby) appointed to count the votes (teller). The chair then confirms the result to the House. The whole process takes between 12 and 15 minutes. Because of the length of time it takes to vote, calling for a division can occasionally be used effectively as a delaying tactic in the House.\nThere is no formal way to abstain in a Commons division, as there is no way to record attendance in the chamber during a vote other than by voting with Ayes or the Noes.

{"context": "\nThe dismal science\n\"The dismal science\" is a derogatory alternative name for economics coined by the Victorian historian Thomas Carlyle in the 19th century. The term drew a contrast with the then-familiar use of the phrase \"gay science\" to refer to song and verse writing. \n\nOrigin\n\nThe phrase \"the dismal science\" first occurs in Thomas Carlyle's 1849 tract called Occasional Discourse on the Negro Question, in which he argued in favor of reintroducing slavery in order to regulate the labor market in the West Indies:\n\nIt was \"dismal\" in \"find[ing] the secret of this Universe in 'supply and demand,' and reducing the duty of human governors to that of letting men alone\". Instead, the \"idle Black man in the West Indies\" should be \"compelled to work as he was fit, and to do the Maker's will who had constructed him\". \n\nFalse etymology\n\nIt is often stated incorrectly that Carlyle gave economics the nickname \"the dismal science\" as a response to the late 18th century writings of Thomas Malthus, who grimly predicted that starvation would result as projected population growth exceeded the rate of increase in the food supply.   Carlyle did indeed use the word \"dismal\" in relation to Malthus' theory in Chartism (1839): \n\nCriticism\n\nCarlyle's view was attacked by John Stuart Mill as making a virtue of toil itself, stunting the development of the weak, and committing the \"vulgar error of imputing every difference which he finds among human beings to an original difference of nature\". \n\nBeyond Carlyle\n\nMany at the time and afterward have understood the phrase in relation to the grim predictions drawn from the principles of 19th century \"political economy\".

{"context": "\nGrantley Herbert Adams\nSir Grantley Herbert Adams, CMG, QC (28 April 1898 \u2013 28 November 1971), was a Barbadian and British West Indian statesman. Adams was a founder of the Barbados Labour Party (BLP), and he was named in 1998 as one of the National Heroes of Barbados.\n\nBiography\n\nAdams was born at Colliston, Government Hill, St. Michael, on 28 April 1898. He was the third child of seven born to Fitzherbert Adams and the former Rosa Frances Turney. Adams was educated at St. Giles and at Harrison College in Barbados. In 1918, he won the Barbados Scholarship and departed the following year for his undergraduate studies at Oxford University. Adams played a single match of first-class cricket for Barbados during the 1925\u201326 season, as a wicket-keeper against British Guiana in the Inter-Colonial Tournament. \n\nAdams was married to Grace Thorne in 1929 at St. John's Church. Their only child, Tom, himself won the Barbados Scholarship and attended Oxford to become a lawyer. Tom Adams would later be elected as Barbados' second Prime Minister in 1976.\n\nPolitical life\n\nAdams was president of the Barbados Workers' Union (BWU) from 1941 to 1954. While being a staunch supporter of the monarchy, Adams and his party also demanded more rights for the poor and for the people. Progress toward a more democratic government in Barbados was made in 1942, when the exclusive income qualification was lowered and women were given the right to vote. By 1949, governmental control was wrested from the planters.\n\nAdams became the Prime Minister of the West Indies Federation, defeating Ashford Sinanan by two votes. (Sinanan went on to serve as Leader of the Opposition of Trinidad's Democratic Labour Party.) Adams served this role from 1958 to 1962; Barbados was one of the ten provinces of the West Indies Federation, an organisation doomed by nationalistic attitudes and by the fact that its members, as British colonies, held limited legislative power.\n\nAs Premier of Barbados, his leadership failed in attempts to form unions such as the BWU, and his continued defence of the monarchy was used by his opponents as evidence that he was no longer in touch with the needs of his country. Errol Walton Barrow, a fervent reformer, became the new people's advocate. Barrow had left the BLP and formed the Democratic Labour Party (DLP) as a liberal alternative to Adams' conservative government. Barrow instituted many progressive social programmes, including free education for all Barbadians, and the School Meals system. By 1961, Barrow had replaced Adams as Premier and the DLP controlled the government.\n\nLegacy\n\nGrantley Adams International Airport, formerly Seawell Airport, located in Christ Church, Barbados, was named after the former Prime Minister in 1976. A statue in honour of Adams is located in front of Government Headquarters at Bay Street, St. Michael.\n\nAdams is one of Barbados' National Heroes. He was the father of Barbados' second Prime Minister following independence, the late J. M. G. \"Tom\" Adams.\n\nAdams was buried in Bridgetown, Barbados, at the churchyard of the Anglican Cathedral Church of Saint Michael and All Angels on Saint Michael's Row.\n\nThe former home of Adams, located on Roebuck Street, Bridgetown, today functions as the headquarters of the Barbados Labour Party political group.

The result is a salt that is very important biologically and commercially. This article discusses sodium chloride, its properties, and its uses.\nWhat Is a Salt?\nWe see it on the tables of restaurants, in shakers at home, and taste it when we swim in the ocean. But what really is a salt?\nSalts are inorganic compounds, which means they do not contain carbon and hydrogen together in one molecule. Salts form when a positively-charged atom, called a cation, attracts a negatively charged atom, known as an anion.\nThis positive to negative attraction is known as an ionic bond and is key in maintaining the chemical structure of salts. One of the most important salts in nature and biological systems is sodium chloride. Let's look at sodium chloride and discuss what makes it such a valuable salt in nature.\nCharacteristics of a Sodium Chloride\nSodium chloride is formed when sodium atoms interact with chlorine atoms. When this occurs, sodium will donate an electron (which is a negatively-charged particle) to chlorine. This makes sodium slightly positive and chlorine slightly negative.\nOpposite charges attract, right? So then, sodium ions will attract chloride ions and form an ionic bond. By the way, chloride is the term used to designate the anion form of chlorine. The result is a crystallized salt that has properties that are different from the two parent elements (sodium and chlorine). The chemical formula for sodium chloride is NaCl, which means that for every sodium atom present, there is exactly one chloride atom.\nSodium chloride has a molar mass of 58.44 grams per mole. It appears as a solid, clear crystal with little or no odor. As a salt, sodium chloride dissolves well in water and the ions in the crystals will separate when in solution. Have you ever added salt to a pot of boiling water, maybe to make pasta? You can see how instantly the little crystals dissolve, or break apart in the water.\nSodium chloride molecules can also stack on top of each other in a structure known as a lattice and the solid crystals of sodium chloride will contain this lattice-type arrangement.\nSodium chloride has many commercial and biological uses. Let's discuss a few of these.\nCommercial Uses of Sodium Chloride\nSodium chloride can be used in many commercial products as well as in public works projects. For example, whenever the temperature drops close to freezing, sodium chloride is often used to prevent ice buildup on the roads and bridges in order to preserve safe driving conditions. Sodium chloride is also used in the production of several commercially-important metals, such as copper, steel, and aluminum. Other uses of sodium chloride include glass production, rubber production, and hardening of soil during construction.\n\u00d7\n", "context_len": 1015, "questions": ["What is NaCl better known as?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Wilkin", "Wilkins (disambiguation)", "WILKINS", "Wilkins"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nWhite paper\nA white paper is an authoritative report or guide that informs readers concisely about a complex issue and presents the issuing body's philosophy on the matter. It is meant to help readers understand an issue, solve a problem, or make a decision. The initial British term concerning a type of government-issued document has proliferated\u2014taking a somewhat new meaning in business. In business, a white paper is closer to a form of marketing presentation, a tool meant to persuade customers and partners and promote a product or viewpoint.    White papers may be considered grey literature.\n\nIn government \n\nThe term white paper originated with the British government, and many point to the Churchill White Paper of 1922 as the earliest well-known example under this name. In British government it is usually the less extensive version of the so-called blue book, both terms being derived from the colour of the document's cover.\n\nWhite papers are a \"... tool of participatory democracy\u00a0... not [an] unalterable policy commitment.\"  \"White papers have tried to perform the dual role of presenting firm government policies while at the same time inviting opinions upon them.\" \n\nIn Canada, a white paper is \"...a policy document, approved by Cabinet, tabled in the House of Commons and made available to the general public.\"  The \"provision of policy information through the use of white and green papers can help to create an awareness of policy issues among parliamentarians and the public and to encourage an exchange of information and analysis. They can also serve as educational techniques.\" \n\nWhite papers are a way the government can present policy preferences before it introduces legislation. Publishing a white paper tests public opinion on controversial policy issues and helps the government gauge its probable impact. \n\nBy contrast, green papers, which are issued much more frequently, are more open-ended. Also known as consultation documents, green papers may merely propose a strategy to implement in the details of other legislation, or they may set out proposals on which the government wishes to obtain public views and opinion.\n\nExamples of governmental white papers include White Paper on Full Employment, White Paper of 1939, and the 1966 Defence White Paper.\n\nIn business-to-business marketing \n\nSince the early 1990s, the term \"white paper\" has been applied to documents used as marketing or sales tools in business. These white papers are long-form content designed to promote the products or services from a specific company. As a marketing tool, these papers use selected facts and logical arguments to build a case favorable to the company sponsoring the document. B2B white papers are often used to generate sales leads, establish thought leadership, make a business case, or inform and persuade prospective customers, channel partners, journalists, analysts, or investors. In digital marketing, white papers are often referred to as a form of content marketing. Many of these white papers argue that one particular technology, product or method is superior for solving a specific business problem. They may also present research findings, list a set of questions or tips about a certain business issue, or highlight a particular product or service from a vendor. \n\nThere are, essentially, three main types of commercial white papers:\n*Backgrounder: Describes the technical or business benefits of a certain vendor's offering, either a product, service, or methodology. This type of white paper is best used to supplement a product launch, argue a business case, or support a technical evaluation at the bottom of the sales funnel.\n*Numbered list: Presents a set of tips, questions, or points about a certain business issue. This type is best used to get attention with new or provocative views, or cast aspersions on competitors, especially by using FUD.\n*Problem/solution: Recommends a new, improved solution to a nagging business problem. This type is best used to generate leads at the top of the sales funnel, build mind share, or inform and persuade stakeholders. \n\nWhile a numbered list may be combined with either other type, it is not workable to combine the detailed product information of a backgrounder with the industry-wide perspective of a problem/solution white paper.\n", "context_len": 778, "questions": ["A government paper setting out proposals and inviting consultation on a policy, before it is ever presented as a White Paper, is identified by what colour?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Basoon", "Bassoonist", "Bassoon", "French bassoon", "Buffet system", "BASSOON", "Fagott", "Bassoons", "Fagotto", "Pancake key (bassoon)", "Heckel system", "Basoonist", "Ba\u00dfoon", "Fagotte"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nOsmotherley, North Yorkshire\nOsmotherley is an English village and civil parish, situated in the Hambleton hills in North Yorkshire.  The village is the western edge of the North York Moors National Park. \n\nOsmotherley is on the route of the 110 mile Cleveland Way National Trail.\n\nOrigin of name\n\nIt is likely that Osmotherley means the clearing or 'ley' (pronounced lee), belonging to a Viking called 'Asmund' or a Saxon called 'Osmund'. There have been a number spellings of the Osmotherley over the centuries: the name appeared in the Domesday Book as Asmundrelac; it has also been known as Osmundeslay and Osmonderlay.\n\nHowever, fanciful local legend says that Osmotherley was named after the mother of a villager named Oswald or Osmund, who supposedly went out to gather firewood in the winter. When she did not return her son became anxious and went out to look for her. He found her lying in the snow, dead or dying from the cold. Because he was not able to carry her back, he lay down beside her and died himself. It is where Oswald's mother lies, hence Osmotherley.\n\nGovernance\n\nAn  electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward stretches both north and south from the village with a total population taken at the 2011 census of 1,764. \nAmenities\n\nThe village school was founded 1857, the present building dates from 1878. The school is now known as Osmotherley Primary School. It is located on School Lane and has 49 pupils.\n\nOsmotherley boasts three pubs within a 55 yd radius: the [http://www.queencatherinehotel.co.uk Queen Catherine], the [http://www.threetunsrestaurant.co.uk Three Tuns] and the [http://www.goldenlionosmotherley.co.uk Golden Lion]. The village was featured on BBC News and Sky News during the Wedding of Prince William of Wales and Catherine Middleton, as it is the only village in the country to boast a pub with the name 'Queen Catherine'.\n\nThe village is served by a newsagents, a 'Top Shop' store, a fish and chip shop, a Youth Hostel and an antique store.\n\nThe shop that has served Osmotherley since 1786, 'Thompson', along with a recently opened Art and Craft Shop have recently closed.\n\nThe public toilets are situated by the side of the Village Hall (which in turn is next to Church House, which hosts book sales and tea sales on Sundays and Bank Holidays.) These toilets have been voted the best in the UK on several occasions and are filled with flowers and decorated with pictures of horses.\n\nReligion\n\nThe Church of England parish church is dedicated to St Peter and is built on an earlier Saxon site, with parts of the building dating from the Norman period. Largely rebuilt by architect C. Hodgson Fowler in 1892, it is a grade II* listed building. \n\nJohn Wesley preached at the barter table in the middle of Osmotherley on several occasions, the first in 1745. In 1754 a Methodist Chapel was erected in Chapel Yard.\n\nOsmotherley is also home to Osmotherley Friends Meeting House, which is a traditional stone building, erected in 1690 or 1723. Meetings are still held here once a month. It is thought that George Fox may have visited the village in the late 17th century.\n\nNearby\n\nCod Beck Reservoir at Osmotherley gets its name from Cod Beck, a small tributary of the River Swale. The beck derives its name from the Celtic word 'Coed', meaning woody. Just before Cod Beck reaches the reservoir is a picturesque location called Sheepwash.\n\nOsmotherley is close to the western terminus of the Lyke Wake Walk.  The official starting point is at the edge of the moors above the village, where there is a stone marker.\n\nAbout 1\u00bd miles from Osmotherley near the A19 is Mount Grace Priory. These beautiful ruins are situated at the foot of a steep wooded hill with a footpath leading up it into the village. This Carthusian religious house was founded around 1396.\n\nIn popular culture\n\nOsmotherley is the setting of some of the final chapters of the novel Brother in the Land by Robert Swindells. In the novel, many towns and cities in it are hit by individually programmed nuclear missiles, but Osmotherley's small size means it is spared.\n", "context_len": 785, "questions": ["Which walking path runs for 42 miles from Osmotherley to Ravenscar?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["The Kinks", "John Gosling (The Kinks musician)", "Gordon John Edwards", "The Ray Davies Quartet", "Kinks", "The Kinks (band)", "Kinks, The", "THE KINKS"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nArt movement\nAn art movement is a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time, (usually a few months, years or decades) or, at least, with the heyday of the movement defined within a number of years. Art movements were especially important in modern art, when each consecutive movement was considered as a new avant-garde.\n\nConcept \n\nAccording to theories associated with modernism and the concept of postmodernism, art movements are especially important during the period of time corresponding to modern art.  The period of time called \"modern art\" is posited to have changed approximately halfway through the 20th century and art made afterward is generally called contemporary art. Postmodernism in visual art begins and functions as a parallel to late modernism  and refers to that period after the \"modern\" period called contemporary art.  The postmodern period began during late modernism (which is a contemporary continuation of modernism), and according to some theorists postmodernism ended in the 21st century.   During the period of time corresponding to \"modern art\" each consecutive movement was often considered a new avant-garde.\n\nAlso during the period of time referred to as \"modern art\" each movement was seen corresponding to a somewhat grandiose rethinking of all that came before it, concerning the visual arts. Generally there was a commonality of visual style linking the works and artists included in an art movement. Verbal expression and explanation of movements has come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an art manifesto,[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/i8066.html \"Poetry of the Revolution. Marx, Manifestos, and the Avant-Gardes\" introduction, Martin Puchner] Retrieved April 4, 2006  and sometimes from art critics and others who may explain their understanding of the meaning of the new art then being produced.\n\nIn the visual arts, many artists, theorists, art critics, art collectors, art dealers and others mindful of the unbroken continuation of modernism and the continuation of modern art even into the contemporary era, ascribe to and welcome new philosophies of art as they appear.   Postmodernist theorists posit that the idea of art movements are no longer as applicable, or no longer as discernible, as the notion of art movements had been before the postmodern era.   There are many theorists however who doubt as to whether or not such an era was actually a fact; or just a passing fad. \n\nThe term refers to tendencies in visual art, novel ideas and architecture, and sometimes literature.

{"context": "\nMexico History - Culture, Religion and Lifestyle in Mexico\nMexico City History | Culture | Religion | MexicoCity.com\nBlog\nMexico History\nThe land of Mexico City has been inhabitated for over 7000 years with the first tribes travelling from Central Europe around 5000 to 300 B.C. Some of the tribes in Mexico City settled around the slopes of mount Benacantil on which today stands the castle of Santa Barbara. The highlight of this mountain was that it wos close to the sea, but yet offered securoty from invaders due to its height. According to some historians, the Iberians (native Spanish) secured the hilltop by fortifying it.\nThe Nahua Aztec or Mexica tribe established Mexico City on 18th March 1325 and it became the capital of a sophisticated growing empire. It was originally located on a small island but because of its rapid growth, the city was forced to build artificial islands and a series of canals to absorb the growth of the metropolis. Rulers like Izcoatl, Moctezuma I, Axayacatl, Tizoc, Ahyuizotl, and Moctezuma II and their groups of eagle-warriors and jaguar-warriors led the city successfully with a pre-Colombian civilization.\nIn 1519, the Spanish conquistador Hernan Cortes entered the area. He acquired the city on 13th August 1521 and in 1524, it was rebuilt as the capital of the viceroyalty of New Spain. It was the political and cultural centre of Mexico and the administration of Guatemala, Yucatan, Cuba, Florida and Philippines was carried out from the city. The baroque Metropolitan Cathedral and the Basilica of Guadalupe were built during this period.\nThe area was under the Spanish rule and when Napoleon acquired Spain in 1808, the people of Mexico started to act for the self-rule under a Catholic priest named Father Miguel de Hidalgo Y Costilla. He led an armed revolution in 1810. This war of independence ended as Mexico became the host of the first ruler of the Mexican Empire, Agustin de Iturbide and the nation became a republic in March 1823. Then in 1824, the new government was established, the Mexican Federal District by the signing of their new constitution. The two-year war with the United States ended in 1848, after losing half of the country to the United States.\nBenito Juarez led the War of Reform which lasted from 1858 to 1861 and he captured the city in 1867. However, in 1871, Porfirio Diaz succeeded to overthrow the government and then the city was under the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz for three decades. During this period the French influence was forced out of Mexico City. The gold Angel of Independence was built under his administration to celebrate the first centenary of the beginning of the War of Independence. In February 1913, Mexico City suffered from the Decena Tragica, a battle between Francisco I. Madero's forces and Felix Diaz's, which destroyed many parts of the city.\nThe post-revolutionary government reinforced the importance of the city. In the late 20th century, Mexico City experienced most of its growth in population. In 1950, the city had a population of around 3 million.\nMexico City was the host for the Olympic Games in 1968 and FIFA World Cup in 1970. The city was hit by an earthquake of magnitude 8.1 on the Richter scale on 19th September 1985 at 07.19 am. It resulted in the deaths of around 5,000 people leaving around 90,000 people homeless. Mexico city again experienced an earthquake of magnitude 7.5 after 36 hours. However, it hosted the FIFA World Cup again in 1986 showing a rapid recovery.\nThe city continued its recovery and growth during the 1990s. Today, Mexico City has a remodeled World Trade Center Mexico, a skyscraper like Torre Mayor, the tallest building in Latin America. The city is ranked 8th among North America\u2019s Top Ten Major Cities. It is one of the major economic and cultural centers with an international importance ranking 4th in Economic Potential and 4th as the Most Cost Effective city.\nRecommended Activities\n", "context_len": 731, "questions": ["Which city was devastated by an earthquake in 1985 and then hosted the World Cup in 1986?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["White House", "202.456.1111", "1600 Pennsylvania Ave.", "White House solar panels", "@WhiteHouse", "202-456-1111", "20500", "White house tours", "The Whitehouse", "+1.202.456.1111", "Whiskey Hotel", "White Home", "+1.202-456-1111", "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue", "The WhiteHouse", "United States White House", "US White House", "White house", "1600 Pennsylvania", "1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW", "1600 Pennsylvania Ave", "The White House", "White House, District of Columbia", "White House Complex", "THE WHITE HOUSE", "202-456-1414"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nRum Jungle, Northern Territory\nRum Jungle is an area in the Northern Territory, Australia where a uranium deposit was found and recognised as such in 1949. It is about 105 kilometres south of Darwin on the East Branch of the Finniss River. \n\nThe area derives its name from an incident when a thief stole 750 ounces of gold from miners after getting them drunk with rum. \n\nOriginal uranium mine\n\nIn 1952 the Australian Government funded the setting up of a mine and treatment plant to provide uranium oxide concentrate to the UK-US Combined Development Agency under a contract which ran from 1953 to 1962. Rum Jungle was then the largest construction in the Northern Territory. The Government, through the Australian Atomic Energy Commission, was responsible for the mine, although management of it was on a contract basis by Territory Enterprises Pty Limited, a subsidiary of the Rio Tinto Group. A town called Batchelor was built 8\u00a0km south of the mine to accommodate the mining personnel.\n\nPollution and cleanup\n\nThe Rum Jungle mine closed in 1971. The Federal Government (which controlled the mine through its agency the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC), now known as Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO)) decided not to rehabilitate the mine site. The mining company Conzinc (now part of the Rio Tinto Group, which owns Energy Resources of Australia (ERA), operators of the Ranger Uranium Mine in Kakadu National Park) have consistently denied any responsibility for rehabilitation. This led to the mine becoming known as one of Australia's most polluted environments  due to the oxidation of sulphides and the release of acid and metals into the East Branch of the Finniss River. The 1500\u00a0mm annual rainfall, along with the pyritic mineralisation in the area, created ideal conditions for such oxidation.\n\nAn initial attempt to clean up Rum Jungle was made in 1977, which led to the setting up of a working group to examine more comprehensive rehabilitation. A $16.2 million Commonwealth-funded program got under way in 1983 to remove heavy metals and neutralise the tailings.\n\nOne of the principal problems associated with rehabilitating the Rum Jungle Creek South (RJCS) open cut was that the area was converted to a lake after mining ceased, and as the only water body in the Darwin region not infested with crocodiles, the site quickly became very popular with locals and Darwin residents as a recreation reserve including activities such as swimming, canoeing and scuba diving.     After mining, the area suffered elevated gamma radiation, alpha-radioactive dust, and significant radon daughter concentrations in air. These levels were so high that in the late 1980s it was decided that something had to be done. Radiation protection standards were being revised, so that the levels of pollution would now be officially recognised as unsafe for human health. As a result, a supplementary $1.8 million program to improve Rum Jungle Creek South waste dumps was undertaken in 1990.\n\nOne of the main environmental impacts of uranium mining is the creation of large volumes of radioactive mine waste (tailings) which are left behind on the site. The major radioactive component of these tailings is uranium-238, an isotope with a halflife of 4.46 billion years. In 2003, a government survey of the tailings piles at Rum Jungle found that capping which was supposed to help contain this radioactive waste for at least 100 years, had failed in less than 20 years.\n \nThe Territory and Federal Governments continue to argue over responsibility for funding rehabilitation on the polluted East Finniss River\n \nContamination of local groundwater has yet to be addressed.\n \n\nBrown's Oxide Project\n\nIn December 2001, Compass Resources lodged a Referral under the EPBC Act with Environment Australia (which is now DEH). That document referred to the proposed development of a large-scale mining project, the Browns Polymetallic Project, that would produce lead, cobalt, copper, nickel and silver over a project life of at least 15 years. As indicated in the 2001 Referral, Compass considered that the Browns Polymetallic Project was a \u2018nuclear action\u2019 under the EPBC Act, on the basis that the project could be considered to include rehabilitating a facility or area in which mining or milling of uranium ore has previously been undertaken.[http://www.nt.gov.au/nreta/environment/assessment/register/brownsoxide/index.html Brown's Oxide - Natural Resources, Environment and the Arts]\n\nCompass suspended its work on the polymetallic proposal in 2002 when low metal prices caused the withdrawal of Compass\u2019s financial partner (Doe Run). \n\nIn 2005, Compass lodged an application for a much smaller project focussing on cobalt, nickel and copper mining. Because this project, the Brown's Oxide Project is much smaller than the polymetallic project proposed previously, Compass is in a position to progress it on its own.\n\nThe Northern Territory Government has completed assessing this project and Ms Marion Scrymgour MLA, Minister for Natural Resources, Environment and Heritage in the Northern Territory Government has advised that she has concluded that the Browns Oxide Project as proposed in the Public Environmental Report and subsequent documents \"can be managed without unacceptable environmental impacts\"\n\nThe Hon. Kon Vatskalis MLA Minister for Mines and Energy announced this approval as \"good news\" during question time in the Northern Territory Parliament on 4 May 2006. To ensure the environment is managed properly, this approval and its recommendations is subject to final review by the Commonwealth Government under a bilateral agreement between the Northern Territory Government and the Commonwealth of Australia. \n\nPending final Commonwealth approval, the project is set to be in production by early 2007.\n\nWhile the project is located near the old Rum Jungle mine, the Browns Oxide Project is targeting copper cobalt and nickel\u2014not uranium. Nonetheless, Compass acknowledges that at some future point it would be interested in mining uranium at the nearby Rum Jungle site (over which it holds a lease). Any proposal to mine uranium would require a totally new application and environmental assessment as a separate project.\n", "context_len": 1094, "questions": ["Uranium deposit Rum Jungle is in which Australian state?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Paul Jackson Pollock", "Pollock, Jackson", "Number 1 (painting)", "Jack the Dripper", "Lavender Mist", "Jackson pollock", "Jackson Polluck", "Jackson Pollock", "Jackson Pollack", "One: Number 31", "Number 1 (Jackson Pollock)", "Pollockian"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

Another wound developed in her    right foot, owing to dry, cracked skin. Doctors tried everything--creams, antibiotics--but    nothing worked.\n\"My doctor told me to give it up, see a psychologist, and have my foot amputated,\"    she recalls.\nMitchell, now 52, had to make a decision soon because the powerful antibiotic    that doctors prescribed for her infection was also wreaking havoc on her bones.    Mitchell was preparing to undergo a dangerous bone marrow transplant when a    friend remembered watching a TV show about European doctors using maggots to    treat wounds like Mitchell's. With nothing to lose, she tried it.\nPam Mitchell in happier times, post-treatment.\nMitchell found a dermatologist willing to perform the procedure, and soon had    600 live maggots wriggling    inside the wound on her left foot, 400 in her right, where they were sealed    in gauze and left for two days.\nGrudging acceptance\nWhen it came time to remove the maggots, Mitchell's doctor was more than a    little repulsed. \"He had never dealt with them before and he said it was like    watching a Wes Craven movie,\" Mitchell remembers. He was also impressed, because    the maggot treatment seemed to be working.\nOver the course of 10 such treatments, wounds that months of expensive procedures    could not mend began    to heal.\nToday, Mitchell walks normally and both wounds are completely healed. She is    now a member of the board for the Biotherapeutics Education and Research Foundation,    a non-profit organization that promotes the medical use of maggots.\n\"They didn't just save my feet, they saved my life,\" Mitchell told LiveScience.    \"They're better than anything man can come up with because I've tried everything.\"\nWhat                      a Leech!\nThe medicinal leech is a segmented worm related to the earthworm.                      A rear suction cup helps it move and cling to a host. The                      front suction cup has three sharp jaws that make a Y-shaped                      bite.\nIt                      can feed for 30 minutes to 6 hours or more, taking in several                      times its body weight.\nLeech                      saliva contains chemicals that prevent blood clotting, so                      a wound might bleed for hours after the leech is removed.                      Depending on wound size, a doctor might apply anywhere from                      one to six leeches. Medical-grade leeches are sold by Leeches                      U.S.A. Ltd. and Biopharm Leeches.\nSOURCE:                      Biotherapeutics Education and Research Foundation\nA growing number of doctors are starting to agree. Maggots are useful because    they help remove dead tissue and expose healthy tissue, a process called debridement.    Maggot debridement therapy was popular in the early part of the last century    but went out of vogue when antibiotic use became widespread.\nBut maggots are now making a comeback, and they are increasingly being used    to treat ulcers, gangrene, skin cancer, and burns. Research also suggests maggots    may help decrease the risks of infections after surgery.\nLeeches, too\nMaggot therapy is just one example of a medical approach called biotherapy    -- the use of living animals to aid in medical diagnosis or treatment. Leeches    are another example.\nIn ancient times, leeches were used to treat everything from headaches to ear    infections to hemorrhoids. Historians think Egyptians used leech therapy 3,500    years ago. The treatments were back in vogue during the Middle Ages, and again    in the 1800s.\nNowadays, leeches are routinely used to drain blood from swollen faces, limbs    and digits after reconstructive surgery.\nThey are especially useful when reattaching small parts that contain many blood    vessels, like ears, where blood clots can easily form in veins that normally    drain blood from tissues. If the clots are severe, the tissues can die -- drowned    in the body's own fluid -- because they are deprived of oxygen and other vital    nutrients.\nScientists are also looking at using leeches to treat other ailments. Studies    led by Andreas Michalsen, a researcher at the University of Duisburg-Essen in    Germany, suggests leech therapy may lessen the pain and inflammation associated    with osteoarthritis, a debilitating disease where bones can grind against one    another because the cartilage has been worn down.\nThe gross factor\nMaggots and leeches are so effective that the FDA last year classified them    as the first live medical devices. The treatments can be relatively inexpensive,    according to the National Institutes of Health. A container of 500-1,000 disinfected    maggots last year cost $70.\nScientists have not figured out exactly how either critter works, but quite    a bit is known. Maggots eat dead and infected tissue and other infectious organisms,    which are later killed in maggots' guts. They secrete enzymes that break down    dead tissue, turning it into a mush they can then slurp up.\nLeech saliva is made up of a potent cocktail of more than 30 different proteins    that, among other things, helps to numb pain, reduce swelling and keep blood    flowing.\nUplink                      Your Views\n", "context_len": 979, "questions": ["What is the name of the blood-sucking worm sometimes used by doctors?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Centeio", "Winter rye", "Rye", "Ryep", "Secale cereale", "Rye (botany)", "Rye (grain)", "Rye Extract", "Oralmat"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nThe Napoleon of Notting Hill\nThe Napoleon of Notting Hill is a novel written by G. K. Chesterton in 1904, set in a nearly unchanged London in 1984.\n\nAlthough the novel is set in the future, it is, in effect, set in an alternative reality of Chesterton's own period, with no advances in technology or changes in the class system or attitudes. It postulates an impersonal government, not described in any detail, but apparently content to operate through a figurehead king, randomly chosen.\n\nSynopsis\n\nThe dreary succession of randomly selected Kings of England is broken up when Auberon Quin, who cares for nothing but a good joke, is chosen.  To amuse himself, he institutes elaborate costumes for the provosts of the districts of London.  All are bored by the King's antics except for one earnest young man who takes the cry for regional pride seriously\u00a0\u2013 Adam Wayne, the eponymous Napoleon of Notting Hill.\n\nWhile the novel is humorous (one instance has the King sitting on top of an omnibus and speaking to it as to a horse: \"Forward, my beauty, my Arab,\" he said, patting the omnibus encouragingly, \"fleetest of all thy bounding tribe\"), it is also an adventure story. Chesterton is not afraid to let blood be drawn in his battles, fought with sword and halberd in the London streets between neighbouring boroughs; Wayne thinks up some ingenious strategies, and Chesterton does not shrink from the death in combat of some of his characters. Finally, the novel is philosophical, contemplating the value and meaning of man's actions and the virtue of respect for one's enemies.\n\nInfluence \n\nMichael Collins, who led the fight for Irish independence from British Rule, is known to have admired the book.  There has been speculation that the setting of the book prompted the date chosen for the setting of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four.  The novel is also quoted at the start of Neil Gaiman's novel Neverwhere.\n\nBoth the novel and Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday are referenced in the 2000 video game Deus Ex\n\nNotes\n", "context_len": 393, "questions": ["Who wrote the 1904 novel The Napoleon of Notting Hill?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Never the Twain", "Never The Twain", "Never the twain"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nPortrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I\nPortrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I (also called The Lady in Gold or The Woman in Gold) is a 1907 painting by Gustav Klimt. The first of two portraits Klimt painted of Bloch-Bauer, it has been referred to as the final and most fully representative work of his golden phase.   It is on display at the Neue Galerie in New York City as part of the largest Klimt collection in the U.S.\n \nAdele Bloch-Bauer (1881\u20131925) was a wealthy member of Viennese society and a patron and close friend of Gustav Klimt.  Klimt originally titled the painting as Adele Bloch-Bauer, but Nazi soldiers seized the painting from the Bloch-Bauer home and displayed it in the early 1940s, removing the name and instead calling it The Woman in Gold so that it could be displayed without referencing a prominent Jewish family. \n\nThe painting\n\nKlimt took three years to complete the painting; preliminary drawings for it date from 1903/4.  It measures 54\" x 54\" [138 x 138\u00a0cm] and is made of oil and gold on canvas, showing elaborate and complex ornamentation as seen in the Jugendstil style. Klimt was a member of the Vienna Secession, a group of artists that broke away from the traditional way of painting. The picture was painted in Vienna and commissioned by Adele's husband Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer.  As a wealthy industrialist who had made his fortune in the sugar industry, he sponsored the arts and favored and supported Gustav Klimt. Adele Bloch-Bauer  became the only model who was painted twice by Klimt when he completed a second picture of her, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer II, in 1912.\n\nOwnership of the painting\n\nIn her will, it is claimed that Adele Bloch-Bauer asked her husband to donate the Klimt paintings to the Austrian State Gallery upon his death.  She died in 1925 from meningitis. When Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938 in the action known as the Anschluss, her widower fled to Prague and subsequently to Zurich. Most of his properties in Austria, including his Klimt paintings, were looted and the attorney Friedrich F\u00fchrer was designated to administer their sale or disposal on behalf of the German state. In 1941, it was acquired by the Austrian state gallery, housed in the Belvedere Palace in Vienna.  \n\nFerdinand Bloch-Bauer died in November 1945 in Zurich. In his 1945 testament, he designated his nephew and nieces, including Maria Altmann, as the heirs of his estate. \n\nIn 2000, following administrative impedance by the Austrian authorities to her claims for restitution of the seized works,  Maria Altmann sued Austria in US Court for ownership of Adele Bloch-Bauer I and other paintings from her uncle's collection. As Bloch-Bauer's pictures had remained in Austria, the Austrian government took the position that the testament of Adele Bloch-Bauer had determined that these pictures were to stay there. After a court battle, binding arbitration by a panel of Austrian judges established in 2006 that Maria Altmann was the rightful owner of this and four other paintings by Klimt.  \n\nIn June 2006 the work was sold for US$135 million to Ronald Lauder for the Neue Galerie in New York City, at the time a record price for a painting.  It has been on display at the Neue Galerie since July 2006. \n\nFilm\n\nMaria Altmann's story is dramatized in the 2015 film Woman in Gold starring Helen Mirren as Maria and Ryan Reynolds as her lawyer E. Randol Schoenberg. \n\nHer recovery of the paintings has also been recounted in three documentary films. Stealing Klimt, released in 2007,  features interviews with Altmann, Schoenberg, and others who were closely involved with the story. Adele's Wish  by filmmaker Terrence Turner, who is the husband of Altmann's great-niece, was released in 2008, and features interviews with Altmann, Schoenberg and leading experts from around the world. The piece was also featured in the 2006 documentary The Rape of Europa, which dealt with the massive theft of art in Europe by the Nazi government during World War II.\n\nBooks\n\nThis piece is featured in the memoir of Gregor Collins, The Accidental Caregiver, about his relationship with Maria Altmann, the niece of Adele Bloch-Bauer. It was published on August 15, 2012, and was turned into a stageplay in New York in January 2015.   \n\nThe tale of the painting and those involved with it is covered in detail in the book by Anne-Marie O'Connor, The Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Tale of Gustav Klimt's Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer, published on February 7, 2012. \n\nThe story of this work, as well as other stories of the clashes between the heirs determined to retrieve their inheritance and the current owners, is told by Melissa M\u00fcller and Monika Tatzkow in Lost Lives, Lost Art: Jewish Collectors, Nazi Art Theft, and the Quest for Justice, published by The Vendome Press on September 1, 2010.\n", "context_len": 903, "questions": ["Who painted Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer in 1907, sold in 2006 for $135 million?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Holly Heston Rochell", "John Charles Carter", "Charleton Heston", "Charleston Heston", "Holly Rochell", "Chuck Heston", "Heston, Charlton", "Carlton Heston", "Holly Heston", "Charlton heston", "Charlton Heston"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

The first newspaper in England was printed in 1641. (However the word newspaper was not recorded until 1670). The first successful daily newspaper in Britain was printed in 1702. The first American newspaper was printed in 1690. It was called Publick Occurrences Both Forreign and Domestick. The first newspaper in Canada was the Halifax Gazette in 1752. The first daily American newspaper was published in 1783.\nIn Britain the first Sunday newspaper was the British Gazette and Sunday Monitor published in 1780. In 1785 the Daily Universal Register was first published. In 1788 it was renamed The Times. In 1814 The Times was printed with a steam-powered press for the first time. In 1848 The Times used a rotary printing press with the printing face wrapped around a cylinder for the first time.\nMeanwhile the Observer was founded in 1791. The Daily Telegraph was first published in 1855. The Manchester Guardian was founded in 1821. It changed its name to The Guardian in 1959. The Sunday Times was first published in 1822. The Financial Times began in 1888. Meanwhile The News Of The World was published in 1843. Meanwhile the first Australian newspaper was published in 1803. It was called the Sydney Gazette and New South Wales Advertiser.\nNewspapers became far more common in the late 19th century. In the 18th century and the early 19th century stamp duty was charged on newspapers, which made them expensive. However in 1855 stamp duty on newspapers was abolished and they became cheaper and more common. In the mid-19th century newspaper reporters began to use the telegraph as a means to get news to their newspapers quickly. Then in 1880 The New York Graphic became the first newspaper to print a photo. In Britain the first tabloid newspaper was the Daily Graphic published in 1890. In 1891 it became the first British newspaper to print a photo.\nModern Newspapers\nIn the 20th century newspapers became still more common. The Daily Mail was first published in 1896, The Daily Express was first published in 1900 and the Daily Mirror began publication in 1903. In 1964 The Daily Herald became The Sun and The Daily Star was founded in 1978. Meanwhile The Sunday Telegraph was founded in 1961 and in 1962 The Sunday Times became the first newspaper to publish a Sunday color supplement. The Mail on Sunday began in 1982. The Independent was first published in 1986. Also in 1986 Today became the first color newspaper in Britain.\nBy the beginning of the 20th century Fleet Street was the center of the British newspaper industry. However in the 1980s newspaper owners moved away from Fleet Street. At that time computer technology replaced the old labor intensive methods of printing. The Press Complaints Commission was created in 1990. Metro, a free newspaper for commuters was first published in Britain in 1999. Then in 2010 an abbreviated version of the Independent called i was launched However in 2011 The News Of The World ceased publication.\n", "context_len": 575, "questions": ["What top-selling UK newspaper was produced on Sundays for the first time in 2012?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["MARTIN LUTHER KING", "The Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Junior", "Martin Luther King,Jr.", "MLK Jr.", "Luther king jr", "Rev.

{"context": "\nIsland country\nAn island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24% ) of the 193 UN member states are island countries.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe percentage of island countries that are democratic is higher than that of continental countries. Historically they have been more prone to political stability than their continental counterparts.\n\nWar\n\nIsland countries have often been the basis of maritime conquest and historical rivalry between other countries. \nIsland countries are more susceptible to attack by large, continental countries due to their size and dependence on sea and air lines of communication. \nMany island countries are also vulnerable to predation by mercenaries and other foreign invaders, \nalthough their isolation also makes them a difficult target. Powerful countries, such as the United Kingdom may develop a navy for protection and promotion of their interests, sometimes known as a sea power.\n\nNatural resources\n\nMany island countries rely heavily on fish for their main supply of food. \nSome are turning to renewable energy\u2014such as wind power, hydropower, geothermal power and biodiesel from copra oil\u2014to combat the rise in oil prices. \n\nGeography\n\nSome island countries are more affected than other countries by climate change, which produces problems such as reduced land use, water scarcity and sometimes even resettlement issues. Some low-lying island countries are slowly being submerged by the rising water levels of the Pacific Ocean. \nClimate change also impacts island countries by causing natural disasters such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, flash floods and drought.  In 2011, the Center for Climate Change Law (CCCL) held a conference attended by 272 registrants from 39 island nations titled Legal Issues for Threatened Island Nations. \n\nEconomics\n\nMany island countries rely heavily on imports and are greatly affected by changes in the global economy. \nThe economies of island countries are usually smaller and more vulnerable to shipping costs, environmental damage to infrastructure, and isolation from other economies than those of larger, continental countries; exceptions include Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom.   \nThe dominant industry for many island countries is tourism. \n\nComposition\n\nIsland countries are typically small with low populations, although some, like Indonesia and Japan are notable exceptions. \n\nSome island countries are centred on one or two major islands, such as the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand, Cuba, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Taiwan. Others are spread out over hundreds or thousands of smaller islands, such as Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Seychelles, and the Maldives. Some island countries share one or more of their islands with other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland; Haiti and the Dominican Republic; and Indonesia, which shares islands with Papua New Guinea, Brunei, East Timor, and Malaysia. Malaysia and Singapore is another example of this and the latter was part of the former up until 1965.\n\nGeographically, the country of Australia is considered a continental landmass rather than an island, covering the largest landmass of the Australian continent. In the past, however, it was considered an island country for tourism purposes  (among others) and is still often referred to as such.\n", "context_len": 589, "questions": ["What island nation was hit by an earthquake and tsunami disaster in October 2010?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Eighth State", "Hurricanes in South Carolina", "South Carolina (state)", "Transport in South Carolina", "The Palmetto State", "Religion in South Carolina", "South Carolina", "US-SC", "Iodine State", "South Carolina (U.S. state)", "State of South Carolina", "8th State", "Transportation in South Carolina", "South carolina", "Geography of South Carolina", "Education in South Carolina", "South Carolina (USA State)", "S.

{"context": "\nStuart Rosenberg\nStuart Rosenberg (August 11, 1927 \u2013 March 15, 2007) was an American film and television director whose motion pictures include Cool Hand Luke (1967), Voyage of the Damned (1976), The Amityville Horror (1979), and The Pope of Greenwich Village (1984).  He was noted for his work with actor Paul Newman.\n\nEarly life\n\nRosenberg was born in Brooklyn, New York City, the son of Sara (n\u00e9e Kaminsky) and David Rosenberg.  He studied Irish literature at New York University in Manhattan, and began working as an apprentice film editor while in graduate school.\n\nCareer\n\nAfter advancing to film editor, he then transitioned into directing with episodes of the  syndicated television series Decoy (1957\u201359), starring Beverly Garland as an undercover police woman. It was the first police series on American television built around a female protagonist. Over the next two years, Rosenberg directed 15 episodes of the ABC police-detective series Naked City (1958\u20131963), which like Decoy was shot in New York City. Meanwhile, Rosenberg was then hired to direct his first film, Murder, Inc. (1960), starring Peter Falk, but a strike by both the Screen Actors Guild and the Writers Guild resulted in his leaving the film and being replaced by its producer, Burt Balaban. Rosenberg returned to television, directing 15 episodes of The Untouchables, eight of the anthology series Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre, five of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and three of The Twilight Zone, along with episodes of Adventures in Paradise, The Barbara Stanwyck Show, Ben Casey, Rawhide with Clint Eastwood, and Falk's The Trials of O'Brien, among other shows. He won a 1963 Emmy Award for directing \"The Madman\", one of his 19 episodes of the courtroom drama The Defenders.\n\nFollowing the Lutheran-financed U.S.-German co-production Question 7 (1961), filmed in West Berlin, Germany, Rosenberg shot the 1965 TV-movie, Memorandum for a Spy and the 1966 telefilm Fame Is the Name of the Game before making his major-studio debut with the Paul Newman hit Cool Hand Luke (1967). Rosenberg had come across Donn Pearce's chain gang novel and developed the film with actor Jack Lemmon's production company, Jalem. Years later, Rosenberg would replace Bob Rafelson on another prison movie, Brubaker (1980) starring Robert Redford.\n\nOther Rosenberg films include The April Fools (1969), with French actress Catherine Deneuve in her American debut opposite Jack Lemmon (who plays the first Rosenberg lead character named H. Brubaker); the Newman movies WUSA (1970), Pocket Money (1972) and The Drowning Pool (1975); the Walter Matthau police-detective thriller The Laughing Policeman (1973); the Charles Bronson action picture Love and Bullets (1979); and another action movie Let's Get Harry (1986), for which Rosenberg used the Directors Guild of America pseudonym Alan Smithee. He was famous for straight dramas and, especially, crime films. The most acclaimed movie he did after 'Cool Hand Luke' was The Pope of Greenwich Village with Eric Roberts, Mickey Rourke, and Daryl Hannah.\n\nHe made his last film, the independent drama My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys, in 1991.\n\nIn 1993, Rosenberg became a teacher at the American Film Institute. Among his students were those who would go on to make names for themselves: Todd Field, Darren Aronofsky, Mark Waters, Scott Silver, Doug Ellin and Rob Schmidt. \n\nPersonal life and legacy\n\nRosenberg died in 2007 of a heart attack at his home in Beverly Hills, California. He was survived by his wife, Margot Pohoryles, whom he had met at NYU; son Benjamin Rosenberg, a first assistant director;  as well as four grandchildren.\n\nHis students' films The Spiderwick Chronicles, The Alphabet Killer, and The Wrestler that were released in 2008 were dedicated in memory of him.\n\nFilmography\n\n*Murder, Inc.

Other broadcasters followed suit. Previously, broadcasters had agreed on the video and script to be used with the DEC, to be shown after primetime news bulletins.\nThe BBC, which has been criticised in the past over alleged bias in its coverage of the Middle East, said it did not want to risk public confidence in its impartiality. A BBC spokesperson said: \"The decision was made because of question marks about the delivery of aid in a volatile situation and also to avoid any risk of compromising public confidence in the BBC's impartiality in the context of [a] news story.\"\nThe DEC's chief executive, Brendan Gormley, said: \"We are totally apolitical ... this appeal is a response to humanitarian principles. The BBC seems to be confusing impartiality with equal airtime.\"\nDEC appeals have recently raised \u00a310m for the Congo and \u00a318m for Burma.\nAn ITV spokesman said the broadcasters, after assessing the DEC's needs, had been unable \"to reach a consensus necessary for an appeal\".\nSky said: \"By convention, if all broadcasters do not carry the appeal, then none do.

They successfully hosted nine episodes and it attracted a lot of viewers. In 2007, Gale and Munro's show contracts expired, so Newton and Zemiro replaced them as presenters. However, it was cancelled by the Nine Network after coming last place in the nightly ratings on 6 August 2007 due to the big win for Channel Seven..\n\nIn a November issue of a TV Week magazine in 2007, Munro claimed he and Gale left the show because the programmers wanted to lighten up the show and make it more fun. Munro explained that he disliked wearing fashionable clothes for that era. But Newton loved wearing them, so he was hired instead of Munro.\n\nThe episodes that remained unaired after the show's axing were broadcast by Channel Nine over the summer non-ratings period, beginning the unaired episodes on 27 December 2007.

{"context": "\nBrabantio\nBrabantio (sometimes called Brabanzio) is a character in William Shakespeare's Othello (c.1601\u20131604). He is a Venetian senator and the father of Desdemona.  He has entertained Othello in his home countless times before the play opens, thus giving Othello and Desdemona opportunity to fall in love.  He is furious upon learning they have eloped, and Desdemona's decision is reported to be the cause of his death in the last act. The character has no counterpart in Shakespeare's source material for the play but is apparently the Bard's complete invention.  He appears in the first act only and is mentioned in the fifth.\n\nOrigin\n\nOthello has its source in the 1565 tale \"Un Capitano Moro\" from Giovanni Battista Giraldi Cinthio's Gli Hecatommithi, a collection of 100 tales in the vein of Boccacio's Decameron.  While no English translation of Cinthio was available in Shakespeare's lifetime, it is possible Shakespeare knew both the Italian original and Gabriel Chappuy's 1584 French translation.  He may have had access to an English translation in manuscript.  Cinthio's tale may have been based on an actual incident occurring in Venice about 1508.  \n\nWhile the principal characters in Shakespeare's play have their counterparts in Cinthio's tale, Brabantio is Shakespeare's invention. The relatives of Cinthio's Disdemona   avenge her death in the closing moments of his tale, but her father is not mentioned as being among them.\n\nRole in Othello\n\nBrabantio makes his first appearance in 1.1 when Iago and Roderigo rouse him with the news that Desdemona has eloped.  In 1.2, Brabantio is led to the Sagittary, where the newlyweds are found and there accuses Othello of using magic to bewitch his daughter.  In 1.3, he brings Othello to trial before the Duke and once again accuses him of using witchcraft upon his daughter.  When Desdemona arrives, she tells her father that she respects him only because they are related, and that Othello is whom she truly loves. Brabantio grudgingly accepts what she says, but not without complaining to the senators in an attempt at having Othello stripped of his title; when this is unsuccessful, he disowns his daughter. In the last scene of the play, 5.2, Brabantio's brother Gratiano reveals that Brabantio died of grief after losing his daughter to Othello.\n\nPerformances\n\nThe first recorded mention of Othello is found in a Revels account indicating the play was performed at Whitehall Palace on November 1, 1604.   The cast list of the performance is likely lost to time, but legend has Shakespeare appearing on stage in minor roles such as Old Adam in As You Like It, and, thus, it is not inconceivable that Shakespeare himself may have played Brabantio. It is possible the actor playing Brabantio \"doubled-up\" and performed another character appearing later in the play.\n\nFilm interpreters of the role include Friedrich K\u00fchne in the 1922 silent version starring Emil Jannings, Hilton Edwards in Orson Welles' 1952 film, Anthony Nicholls in Laurence Olivier's 1965 film, and Pierre Vaneck in the 1995 film starring Laurence Fishburne.\n", "context_len": 567, "questions": ["Brabantio is whose father in Shakespeare's play Othello?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Shekel", "Chatzi hashekel", "Shekal", "Shekalim", "Sheqels", "Sheqalim", "SheK.", "Shekels", "She\u1e32.", "Half shekel", "Chatzi shekel", "Sheqel"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nWhy do some libraries use the Dewey Decimal System and ...\nWhy do some libraries use the Dewey Decimal System and others use the Library of Congress system? - Quora\nQuora\nWritten Jan 7, 2011\nThe classification system a library uses depends on its collection, not how big or small a library is. Additionally, one classification system isn't inherently easier to use (or \"better\")\u00a0 than any other classification system. Librarians choose (or inherit) a classification system based on the collection and its \"aboutness\" and in a way that will (ideally) provide access to the items.\nAs an example...how do you organize your personal music collection? I'm guessing you don't use Dewey or LC. I'm guessing you use a system appropriate to the items in your collection and how you want to access them (alphabetically by artist? sorted by genre? by color of the cover art?). Is your entire music collection digital? Or does it include CD's? Do you have any albums? 8-tracks? 45's? You'd organize (classify) your collection differently based on its \"aboutnes.\"\u00a0 If your entire music collection consisted of variations of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony you'd classify it differently than if the collection consisted of equal parts rap, opera, world music, bluegrass, etc.\nIt's much the same with libraries. They organize their collection(s) based on what is IN the collection. In the U.S., there are some legacy reasons libraries continue to use LC and Dewey, but some libraries don't use Dewey or LC at all. Instead, they use broad categories (e.g. \"Self Help,\" \"Gardening,\" Poetry\") to organize their collections. Libraries in other countries may use different classification systems entirely, e.g. Bliss or Colon. Very specialized libraries, such as a Shakespeare library or a culinary library, may use their own \"homegrown\" systems.\nYes, academic libraries _tend_ to use LC, and public libraries _tend_ to use Dewey. But that's definitely not a hard and fast rule.\nWritten Jan 4, 2011\nThe Dewey Decimal (DDC) system was invented by Melvil Dewey in 1876. Dewey also founded the first library school in America and started the American Library Association, the largest professional organization for librarians in the country. So Dewey had a huge influence on American libraries, which is why many used his system of classification. The Library of Congress developed the Library of Congress (LC) classification system in 1897. In 1968, Henriette Davidson, a programmer at the Library of Congress, developed the MARC (MAchine Readable Cataloging) standard for bibliographic records. This standard enabled the electronic exchange of bibliographic data. LC created a huge database of MARC records. Instead of creating their own records, libraries could download a MARC record, or order printed cards. Since the records were created by the Library of Congress, they used the LC classification system. More and more libraries chose to save time and money by downloading their catalog records instead of creating them from scratch. So the decision by libraries to go with LC instead of DDC is based more on economics than anything else.\n", "context_len": 609, "questions": ["\"Whose \"\"Decimal System\"\" is used to organize libraries?\""], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Lavoisierian", "Lavosier, Antoine", "LAVOISIER", "Laviosier", "Antoine de Lavoisier", "The republic has no need for genius", "Lavosier", "Antoine Lavoseir", "AntoineLavoisier", "Antoine Lavosier", "Antoine Laurent Lavoisier", "Antoine Lavoisier", "Antoine-Laurent de Lavoisier", "Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier", "Antoine-Laurent", "Lavoisier", "Lavoisier, Antoine-Laurent", "Antione Lavoisier", "Antoine Laviosier", "A.

{"context": "\n400 metres\nThe 400\u00a0metres, or 400 metre dash, is a common sprinting event in track and field competitions. It has been featured in the athletics programme at the Summer Olympics since 1896 (1964 for women). On a standard outdoor running track, it is exactly one lap around the track. Runners start in staggered positions and race in separate lanes for the entire course. In many countries, athletes previously competed in the 440 yard dash (402.336\u00a0m)\u2014which is the length of a quarter of a mile and was referred to as the 'quarter-mile'\u2014instead of the 400\u00a0m (437.445\u00a0yards), though this distance is now obsolete. An athlete who competes in the 400\u00a0m may still be referred to as 'quarter-miler'; the distance or event might still be called the \"quarter.\"\n\nMaximum sprint speed capability is a significant contributing factor to success in the event, but athletes also require substantial speed endurance and the ability to cope well with high amounts of lactic acid to sustain a fast speed over a whole lap. While considered to be predominantly an anaerobic event, there is some aerobic involvement and the degree of aerobic training required for 400\u00a0metre athletes is open to debate. \n\nThe United States dominates the men's event. The current men's world record is held by Michael Johnson, with a time of 43.18\u00a0seconds. The world indoor record holder is Kerron Clement, in 44.57\u00a0seconds. The current women's world record is held by Marita Koch, with a time of 47.60\u00a0seconds. Grenadan Kirani James is the reigning men's Olympic champion, while South African Wayde van Niekerk holds the world title; Allyson Felix is the reigning women's world champion, while Sanya Richards-Ross holds the women's Olympic title. The men's T43 (classification) Paralympic world record of 45.07\u00a0seconds is held by Oscar Pistorius. \n\nAn Olympic double of 200\u00a0metres and 400\u00a0m was first achieved by Valerie Brisco-Hooks in 1984, and later by Michael Johnson from the United States and Marie-Jos\u00e9 P\u00e9rec of France both in 1996. Alberto Juantorena of Cuba at the 1976 Summer Olympics became the first and so far the only athlete to win both the 400\u00a0m and 800\u00a0m Olympic titles.\n\nThe Olympic champion has frequently won a second gold medal in the 4 \u00d7 400 metres relay, accomplished 14 times by men; Charles Reidpath, Ray Barbuti, Bill Carr, George Rhoden, Charles Jenkins, Otis Davis, Mike Larrabee, Lee Evans, Viktor Markin, Alonzo Babers, Steve Lewis, Quincy Watts, Jeremy Wariner and LaShawn Merritt; and 4 times by women;  Monika Zehrt, Valerie Brisco-Hooks, Olga Bryzgina and Sanya Richards-Ross.\n\nAll-time top 25 men\n\n*As of July 2016\n\nNotes\n\nBelow is a list of all other times equal or superior to 43.75.\n*Michael Johnson also ran 43.39 (1995), 43.44 (1996), 43.49 (1996), 43.65 (1993) 43.66 (1995), 43.66 (1996), 43.68 (1998), 43.68 (2000), 43.74 (1993), 43.75 (1997)\n*Jeremy Wariner also ran 43.50 (2007), 43.62 (2006)\n*Quincy Watts also ran 43.71 (1992)\n*LaShawn Merritt also ran 43.74 (2013), 43.75 (2008)\nA =  time was set at altitude.\n\nAll-time top 25 Women\n\n*As of July 2016\n\nNotes\n\nBelow is a list of all other times superior to 48.80.\n*Marita Koch also ran 48.16 (1982), 48.16 (1984), 48.22 (1986), 48.26 (1984), 48.60 (1987), 48.77 (1982)\n*Jarmila Kratochv\u00edlov\u00e1 also ran 48.45 (1983), 48.61 (1981)\n*Olga Vladykina / Bryzgina also ran 48.60 (1985), 48.65 (1988)\n*Ta\u0165\u00e1na Kocembov\u00e1 also ran 48.73 (1984)\n\nFastest relay splits\n\nMen\n\nWomen\n\nMost successful athletes\n\nMultiple (3 or more) 400\u00a0metres victories at the Olympic Games and World Championships:\n\n*6 wins: Michael Johnson (USA) - Olympic Champion in 1996 and 2000, World Champion in 1993, 1995, 1997 and 1999.\n*4 wins: Marie-Jose Perec (FRA) - Olympic Champion in 1992 and 1996, World Champion in 1991 and 1995.\n*3 wins: Cathy Freeman (AUS) - Olympic Champion in 2000, World Champion in 1997 and 1999\n*3 wins: Jeremy Wariner (USA) - Olympic Champion in 2004, World Champion in 2005 and 2007.\n*3 wins: Christine Ohuruogu (GBR) - Olympic Champion in 2008, World Champion in 2007 and 2013.\n*3 wins: LaShawn Merritt (USA) - Olympic Champion in 2008, World Champion in 2009 and 2013.\n\nOlympic medalists\n\nMen\n\nWomen\n\nWorld Championships medalists\n\nMen\n\nWomen\n\nSeason's bests\n\nAs of August 28, 2015\n\nMen\n\nWomen\n\nNotes and references\n", "context_len": 901, "questions": ["Who was the first man to win Olympic Gold medals at 200 and 400 metres?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["\ud83d\udea2", "-ship", "Ships", "Wooden ship", "Ship", "Ship or vessel"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nBray, Berkshire\nBray, occasionally Bray on Thames, is a large village and civil parish in the English county of Berkshire. It borders the River Thames, and lies to the south and south-southeast of Maidenhead, which it neighbours. \n\nThe civil parish of Bray is far larger than the village itself and includes a number of other villages and hamlets over an area of 2498 ha .  It had a population of 8,425 at the 2001 census. \n\nThe village is mentioned in the comedic song The Vicar of Bray. Bray contains two of the four three-Michelin-starred restaurants in the United Kingdom and has several large business premises including Bray Studios, where the first series of Hammer Horror films were produced.\n\nTransport\n\nGeography\n\nBray is a large parish, although its area has shrunk considerably since Maidenhead was detached. As well as the village, the parish contains a large number of villages and hamlets, often greens, which were originally scattered amongst the remains of the dense woodland of Windsor Forest that once covered the area. These include: Bray Wick, Holyport, Water Oakley, Oakley Green, Moneyrow Green, Stud Green, Foxley Green, Touchen End, Braywoodside, Hawthorn Hill and Fifield.\n\nExpensive houses on the river upstream of Bray Lock have been referred to as 'Millionaires' row' in the national press. The flood risk of these houses has been decreased by the Jubilee River, a large drainage ditch dug between north Maidenhead and Datchet.\n\nMonkey Island, in the Thames, is associated with the 3rd Duke of Marlborough, and houses two amusing structures that he built and furnished with paintings of monkeys, and the architecturally Grade I (listed) Monkey Island Hotel. \n\nParish church\n\nSee St Michael's Church, Bray.\n\nThe Church of England parish church of St Michael was built in 1293, supposedly to replace a Saxon church at Water Oakley.  It has a number of sculptures which may have come from the earlier church, including a damaged Sheela na Gig. It is best known to brass rubbers for housing the superb memorial brass of 1378 to Sir John Foxley, the Constable of Southampton Castle, and his two wives. One of the local cottages has a tunnel which it is believed leads to the church and served as an escape route for clergymen. The current Vicar of Bray is the Reverend Richard Cowles.\n\nThe ecclesiastical parish shares the wide parish boundaries and is named Bray St Michael with Braywoodside. \n\nAlmshouse\n\nThe Jesus Hospital is a red-brick group of almhouses, founded in 1609 by William Goddard to house thirty-four of the aged poor of Bray and six of the Worshipful Company of Fishmongers, to which he belonged.  A full-size effigy of Goddard stands over the entrance,  Jesus Hospital is now run by The Donnington Hospital Trust having been transferred from the Fishmongers Company in 2010.\n\nRestaurants\n\nBray contains two of the four three-Michelin-starred restaurants in the United Kingdom: \n\nThe Fat Duck is a restaurant run by chef Heston Blumenthal in the centre of Bray. The restaurant was opened in 1995  and has held a three-star Michelin Guide rating since 2004. In 2005, it was named as the best restaurant in the world by Restaurant magazine  and in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Best Restaurant in the UK,  scoring a maximum 10 out of 10 in the Good Food Guide.\n\nThe Waterside Inn was founded in 1972 by the brothers Michel and Albert Roux after their success with Le Gavroche. It is currently run by Michel's son, Alain and Cavaliere Diego Masciaga. The restaurant has three Michelin stars and in 2010 became the first restaurant outside France to retain all three stars for twenty five years. \n\nLiterature \n\nEdward Lear makes reference to Bray in More Nonsense Pictures, Rhymes, Botany, etc: \n\n\"There was an old person of Bray,\nWho sang through the whole of the day\nTo his ducks and his pigs,\nWhom he fed upon figs,\nThat valuable person of Bray.\"\n\nNotable people\n\n* Sylvia Anderson \u2013  Co creator of the Thunderbird Puppet Series and voice of Lady Penelope.\n* Heston Blumenthal (b. 1966) \u2013 The TV chef runs The Fat Duck  and The Hinds Head Hotel restaurants in Bray\n* Rolf Harris (b. 1930) \u2013 Australian artist, musician, TV presenter, convicted of indecent assault against children and sentenced to 5 years and 9 months in prison   \n* George Mountbatten, 2nd Marquess of Milford Haven (1892-1938) \u2013 buried in Bray Cemetery\n* Sir Michael Parkinson (b. 1935) \u2013 journalist and TV presenter\n* Sasima Srivikorn - Thai businesswomen and Chairwoman / co owner of Reading Football Club\n\nNearest places\n", "context_len": 853, "questions": ["Which restaurant in Bray, Berkshire, was at the centre of a novovirus scare in 2009?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["KIPPS", "Kipps"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nChesapeake (novel)\nChesapeake is a novel by James A. Michener, published by Random House in 1978. The story deals with several families living in the Chesapeake Bay area, from 1583 to 1978.\n\nPlot summary\n\nThe storyline, like much of Michener's work, depicts a number of characters over a long time period. Each chapter begins with a voyage which provides the foundation for the chapter plot. It starts in 1583 with American Indian tribes warring, moves through English settlers throughout the 17th century, slavery and tobacco growing, pirate attacks, the American Revolution and the Civil War, Emancipation and attempted assimilation, to the final major event being the Watergate scandal. The last voyage, a funeral, is in 1978.\n\n* Voyage One: 1583\n* The River\n* Voyage Two: 1608\n* The Island\n* Voyage Three: 1636\n* The Marsh\n* Voyage Four: 1661\n* The Cliff\n* Voyage Five: 1701\n* Rosalind's Revenge\n* Voyage Six: 1773\n* Three Patriots\n* Voyage Seven: 1811\n* The Duel\n* Voyage Eight: 1822\n* Widow's Walk\n* Voyage Nine: 1832\n* The Slave-Breaker\n* Voyage Ten: 1837\n* The Railroad\n* Voyage Eleven: 1886\n* The Watermen\n* Voyage Twelve: 1938\n* Ordeal by Fire\n* Voyage Thirteen: 1976\n* Refuge\n* Voyage Fourteen: 1978\n\nThemes and motifs \n\nThe novel has a number of central themes, such as religion, slavery, poverty, and industry, each personified by a particular family that settles on the bay, and in some cases, by several families.\n\nThe religious element of the novel applies to the Steeds, who are Roman Catholic and the Paxmores who are Quakers. At one point there is a religious debate between Ralph Steed, a priest, and Ruth Brinton, a matriarch of the Paxmore family. Their disagreement is mainly about slavery.\n\nSlavery is an overriding theme of the entire book. The Steeds are great landowners and one of the greatest holders of slaves in the colonies, whereas the Paxmores, through Ruth Brinton, are the first proponents of emancipation. It is said that the Choptank Quaker's Association is the first religious organization to ban slavery. Later in the book, Cudjo Cater is captured in Africa and put to work on the Steed plantation, where he buys his freedom and settles in the nearby township with a wife. The Cater family is forever affected by slavery, even after emancipation, as evidenced when Jeb Cater tries to get his son treated for an ear infection. Prior to the Civil War, the Paxmores form the Maryland link of the Underground Railroad to Pennsylvania, which Cudjo contemplates using before he buys his freedom.\n\nPoverty is best shown in the living standards of the Turlocks, who live in a marsh on the riverside. While they are one of the closest families to nature throughout the whole novel, akin to most of the Indians, they live in the same one bedroom shack built in the 17th century, and the children often watch the adult's sexual activity. However, by the end of the book, at least some of the Turlocks have risen out of poverty. The head of the Turlock family in 1978 is a wealthy real estate broker, selling waterside properties to a well-heeled clientele; one of his customers is a returning member of the Steed family. The other side of poverty is the place in the township dubbed \"The Neck\" in the 20th century, where all the Negro housing is, including a separate school and baseball diamond. Living standards are greatly reduced in \"The Neck\", with the school teacher managing multiple years, and children counting themselves privileged to have either a book or a desk. \"The Neck\" is eventually burned down by black activists, one of them Jeb Cater's son.\n\nIndustry is seen in how each family builds their life up around them due to need, and eventually flourishes. It starts with Pentaquod, the Indian, who settles on a clifftop which is paradise to him. Edmund Steed settles on Devon Island and builds his home, complete with chapel, and founds his great plantation from the ground up with land bought from the Indians. The Steeds eventually own thousands of acres and are extremely wealthy. The Paxmores start with Edward Paxmore, a Quaker carpenter, being banished from Massachusetts and building his house on a cliff overlooking the Choptank. He learns how to build a boat because of necessity and with only help from Indians, and eventually learns how to build an oceangoing ship. His boat building business becomes highly successful and thrives in the township. The Caters struggle for a long time, until 'Big Jimbo' Cater becomes a cook for an oyster skipjack. He eventually earns enough money to buy his own skipjack, which he staffs with his family, and becomes a successful captain. The Caveneys, who emigrated from Ireland due to the Potato Famine, are easily assimilated into the town, and become central characters in the oyster and duck subplots. As can be seen from each family's success through determination, the message is that they worked hard and attained great things.\n\nAllusions/references to actual history and geography\n\nMost of the events of the novel take place on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, and, more specifically, on and around the Choptank River. Devon Island is fictional; its location would be immediately north of Todds Point, approximately 3 miles southeast of the southern tip of Tilghman Island.  Michener lived near there, in St. Michaels, while he worked on the book.  The town of Patamoke lies on a fictitious promontory on the Choptank opposite Cambridge. \n\nThe Quaker Meeting House that Michener places in Patamoke in the novel, is actually Third Haven Meeting House, built in Easton in the 1680s; it is the oldest Quaker meeting house in the United States (see List of the oldest churches in the United States).\n", "context_len": 1106, "questions": ["Who wrote the novel 'Chesapeake'?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Arturo toscanini", "Arturo Toscinini", "Arturo Toscannini", "Toscanini", "ARTURO TOSCANINI", "Arturo Toscanini", "Charles O'Connell (music producer)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nGatun Lake\nGatun Lake (Sp. Lago Gat\u00fan) is a large artificial lake to the south of Col\u00f3n, Panama. It forms a major part of the Panama Canal, carrying ships for 33 km of their transit across the Isthmus of Panama.\n\nThe lake was created between 1907 and 1913 by the building of the Gatun Dam across the Chagres River.  At the time it was created, Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world. Gatun Dam was also the largest of its kind.\n\nDescription \n\nThe lake is situated in the valley of the Chagres River.  It was formed, and the river widened and deepened, by the construction of the Gatun Dam about 10 km from the river's mouth in the Caribbean Sea in 1907\u20131913.  The geography of the area was ideal for the creation of a large lake here; the hills bordering the valley of the Chagres open up widely around the area of the lake, but come together to form a gap just over 2 km wide at the location of the dam.  The damming of the river flooded the originally wooded valley; almost a century later, the stumps of old mahogany trees can still be seen rising from the water, and submerged snags form a hazard for any small vessels that wander off the marked channels.\n\nGatun Lake has an area of 425 km2 at its normal level of 26\u00a0m (85\u00a0ft) above sea level; it stores 5.2 cubic kilometres (183,000,000,000\u00a0ft\u00b3) of water, which is about as much as the Chagres River brings down in an average year.\n\nWith the creation of the lake many hilltops became islands.  The biggest and best known of them is Barro Colorado Island, home of the world famous Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute (STRI).\n\nThe lake has given its name to the Gatun structure, which may be an eroded impact crater.\n\nRole in the canal \n\nGatun Lake forms a major component of the Panama Canal; the lake, including the flooded arm extending up the Chagres River, makes up  of the raised part of the waterway, the other part being the  Culebra Cut.\n\nThe canal follows a clearly marked route around the lake's islands, following the deeper water south from Gatun Locks, and then east.  A small \"shortcut\" channel, the \"Banana Cut\", runs between the islands, providing a slightly shorter route through the lake; this is used by canal launches and yachts to cut a little time off the crossing, and to avoid the heavy ship traffic.\n\nThe lake is also important as a reservoir of water for the operation of the canal locks.  Each time a ship transits the canal 202000 m3 of water is passed from the lake into the sea; with over 14,000 vessel transits per year, this represents a very large demand for water.  Since rainfall is seasonal in Panama, the lake acts as a water store, allowing the canal to continue operation through the dry season.\n\nA major factor in water regulation is the ability of the rainforest in the lake's watershed to absorb rainfall, releasing it gradually into the lake.  However, significant deforestation of the watershed has cleared away much of the vegetation, and reduced the area's water capacity.  This has resulted in falling water levels in the lake during the dry season.  Coupled with the massive increase in canal traffic since its opening, and the resultant increase in water usage, this is an ongoing problem for the canal (see Panama Canal: Water issues).\n\nGatun Lake supplementary benefits\n\nCreated in 1913 by the damming of the Chagres River, Gatun Lake is an essential part of the Panama Canal which forms a water passage between the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean, permitting ship transit in both directions. At the time it was formed, Gatun Lake was the largest man-made lake in the world. The impassable rain-forest around Gatun Lake has been the best defense of the Panama Canal. Today these areas have endured practically unscathed by human interference and are one of the few accessible areas on Earth where various native Central American animal and plant species can be observed undisturbed in their natural habitat.\n\nBarro Colorado Island, which was established for scientific study when the lake was formed and is today operated by the Smithsonian Institution, is the largest island on Gatun Lake. Many of the most important ground breaking scientific and biological discoveries of the tropical animal and plant kingdom originated here. Lake Gatun encompasses approximately 180 sqmi, a tropical ecological zone part of the Atlantic Forest Corridor and ecotourism on Gatun Lake has become a worthwhile industry for Panamanians. Gatun Lake also serves to provide the millions of gallons of water necessary to operate the Panama Canal locks each time a ship passes through and provides drinking water for Panama City and Colon.\n\nAngling is one of the primary recreational pursuits on Gatun Lake. Non-native Peacock Bass were introduced by accident to Gatun Lake around 1967  by a local businessman,  and have since flourished to become the dominant angling game fish in Gatun Lake. Locally called Sargento, and believed to be the species Cichla Pleiozona,  these peacock bass are not a native game fish of Panama but originate from the Amazon, Rio Negro and Orinoco river basins of South America where they are called Tucanare or Pavon and are considered a premier game fish.\n\nNotes\n", "context_len": 991, "questions": ["The artificial Gatun Lake that was created between 1907 and 1913 forms a major component of what water body?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Allende Gossens", "Salvador Gossens", "Allende, Salvador", "(Salvador) Allende", "Salvador Allende", "Salvador Gossens Allende", "Allende's last speech", "Salvador Allende Gossens"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nFolies Berg\u00e8re\nThe Folies Berg\u00e8re is a cabaret music hall, located in Paris, France.\n\nEstablished in 1869, the house was at the height of its fame and popularity from the 1890s' Belle \u00c9poque through the 1920s' Ann\u00e9es folles. The institution is still in business, and is always a strong symbol of French and Parisian life.\n\nHistory\n\nLocated at 32 rue Richer in the 9th Arrondissement, the Folies Berg\u00e8re was built as an opera house by the architect Plumeret. The closest m\u00e9tro stations are Cadet and Grands Boulevards.\n\nIt opened on 2 May 1869 as the Folies Tr\u00e9vise, with light entertainment including operettas, op\u00e9ra comique (comic opera), popular songs, and gymnastics. It became the Folies Berg\u00e8re on 13 September 1872, named after a nearby street, the rue Berg\u00e8re (\"berg\u00e8re\" means \"shepherdess\").   The American impresario Florenz Ziegfeld, Jr., named his light-hearted, extravagant Broadway revues the Ziegfeld Follies (1907-1931), after the Parisian venue.\n\nIn 1882, \u00c9douard Manet painted his well-known painting A Bar at the Folies-Berg\u00e8re which depicts a bar-girl, one of the demimondaines, standing before a mirror.\n\nIn 1886, \u00c9douard Marchand conceived a new genre of entertainment for the Folies Berg\u00e8re: the music-hall revue. Women would be the heart of Marchand's concept for the Folies. In the early 1890s, the American dancer Loie Fuller starred at the Folies Berg\u00e8re. In 1902, illness forced Marchand to leave after 16 years. \n\nIn 1918, Paul Derval (1880\u20131966) made his mark on the revue. His revues were to feature extravagant costumes, sets and effects, and his \"small nude women\". Derval's small nude women would become the hallmark of the Folies. During his 48 years at the Folies, he launched the careers of many French stars including  Maurice Chevalier, Mistinguett, Josephine Baker, Fernandel and many others. In 1926, Josephine Baker, an African-American expatriate singer, dancer, and entertainer, caused a sensation at the Folies Berg\u00e8re in a new revue, La Folie du Jour, in which she danced a number Fatou wearing a costume consisting of a skirt made of a string of artificial bananas and little else. Her erotic dancing and near nude performances were renowned. The Folies Berg\u00e8re catered to popular taste. Shows featured elaborate costumes; the women's were frequently revealing, practically leaving them naked, and shows often contained a good deal of nudity. Shows also played up the \"exoticness\" of persons and objects from other cultures, obliging the Parisian fascination with the n\u00e9gritude of the 1920s.\n\nIn 1936, Derval brought Josephine Baker from New York to lead the revue En Super Folies. Michel Gyarmathy, a young Hungarian arrived from Balassagyarmat, his hometown, designed the poster for En Super Folies, a show starring Josephine Baker in 1936. This began a long love story between Michel Gyarmathy, Paris, the Folies Berg\u00e8re and the public of the whole world which lasted 56 years. The funeral of Paul Derval was held on 20 May 1966. He was 86 and had reigned supreme over the most celebrated music hall in the world. His wife Antonia, supported by Michel Gyarmathy, succeeded him. In August 1974, the Folies Antonia Derval passed on the direction of the business to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Martini, the empress of the night (25 years earlier she had been a showgirl in the revues). This new mistress of the house reverted to the original concept to maintain the continued existence of the last music hall which remained faithful to the tradition.\n\nSince 2006, the Folies Berg\u00e8re has presented some musical productions with Stage Entertainment like Cabaret (2006\u20132008) or Zorro the Musical (2009\u20132010).\n\nPerformers \n\nFilmography \n\n* 1935: Folies Berg\u00e8re de Paris directed by Roy Del Ruth, with Maurice Chevalier, Merle Oberon, and Ann Sothern\n* 1935: Folies Berg\u00e8re de Paris directed by Marcel Achard with Maurice Chevalier, Natalie Paley, Fernand Ledoux.

In the 1930s and '40s the impresario Clifford C. Fischer staged several Folies Bergere productions in the United States. These included the Folies Berg\u00e8re of 1939 at the Broadway Theater in New York  and the Folies Berg\u00e8re of 1944 at the Winterland Ballroom   in San Francisco.\n\nThe Las Vegas Folies Bergere, which opened in 1959, closed at the end of March 2009 after nearly 50 years in operation.

{"context": "\nLegendary creature\nA legendary creature is an animal described in non-historical stories that sometimes involve the supernatural. Other legendary animals, such as the unicorn, were claimed in accounts of natural history by various scholars of antiquity.\n\nThe definitions of legendary and mythological have been debated with no widely agreed upon application. Some legendary creatures have their origin in traditional mythology and were believed to be real creatures, for example dragons, griffins, and unicorns.   Others were based on real encounters, originating in garbled accounts of travelers' tales, such as the Vegetable Lamb of Tartary, which supposedly grew tethered to the earth (and was actually a type of fern). \n\nMedieval symbolism of legendary creatures \n\nThe origins to many legendary creatures can be found in writings from the Middle Ages. These descriptions emerged as ways to convey important concepts and messages through symbolism and metaphor rather than function as literal interpretations. Medieval accounts of these creatures often appear quite whimsical, but it should be understood that portraying the natural world\u2019s physical accuracy was not likely a relevant priority.\n\nUnicorns have a variety of interesting descriptions. These creatures were described as extraordinarily swift and unable to be caught by traditional methods.  It was believed that the only way for one to catch this beast was to lead a virgin to its dwelling. Then, the unicorn was supposed to leap into her lap and go to sleep, at which point a hunter could finally capture it. In terms of symbolism, the unicorn was a metaphor for Christ. Unicorns represented the idea of innocence and purity. In the King James Bible, Psalm 92:10 states, \"My horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn.\" This is because the translators of the King James erroneously translated the Hebrew word re'em as unicorn. The unicorn was described as a sort of young goat with a solitary horn in the middle of its brow. In Christian hermeneutics, the single horn represents the unity between The Father and Christ.  The unicorn\u2019s small size signifies the humility of Christ.\n\nAnother common legendary creature which served allegorical functions within the Middle Ages was the dragon. Dragons were identified with serpents, though their attributes were greatly intensified. The dragon was supposed to have been larger than all other animals. It was believed that the dragon had no harmful poison but was able to slay anything it embraced without any need for venom. Biblical scriptures speak of the dragon in reference to the devil, and they were used to denote sin in general during the Middle Ages. Dragons were said to have dwelled in places like Ethiopia and India, based on the idea that there was always heat present in these locations.\n\nMedieval communities did not only apply legendary characteristics to imaginary animals. Existing creatures were often given extraordinary descriptions. Vultures were considered to be virtuous, and promote good health.  Remedies for migraines, eye problems, and possession were derived from vultures. It was said rubbing its grease into a traction animal you are selling would always allow one to receive the asking price. Dogs also acquired many mythological connotations. It was believed that the gall of a black male dog could act as a talisman protecting a house from evil medicines. Also, the tick from the left ear of a dog, worn as an amulet, was said to relieve all pains. Elephants were frequently utilized for symbolic purposes. As with many interpretations of our world in medieval times, the elephant\u2019s significance alluded to religion. It was said that elephants illustrated God\u2019s graciousness to man.  \"God ordained the elephant, so vast in size, to be subject to man\u2026because we have been made in the likeness of God and may observe His incalculable wisdom in the biggest of animals.\"\n\nWhile many of these creatures serve the purpose of symbolizing religious concepts, others point to social aspects of the medieval period. This is evidenced in the centaur. The invention of the stirrup allowed people to become more unified with their horses. This led to a revolutionary way of conducting battle from horseback, and embodied the ideology behind the mythological centaur. Historian Lynn White argued that the stirrup was the most critical development in medieval Europe. White concluded, \"Antiquity imagined the Centaur; the early Middle Ages made him the master of Europe.\"  Stirrups played a crucial role in the lives of people at this time, and the centaur served as an appropriate symbol to express this importance.\n\nImaginary or not, animals served allegorical functions for people in this time period. Physical detail was not the central focus of the artists depicting them, and medieval bestiaries were not proper biological categorizations. Creatures like the unicorn and griffin were not categorized in a separate \"mythological\" section in medieval bestiaries. Such a distinction was irrelevant as the symbolic implications were of primary importance. Animals we know to have existed were still presented with a fantastical approach. It seems the religious and moral implications of animals were far more significant than matching a physical likeness in these renderings. In The Medieval Artist\u2019s Dilemma in Depicting Animals, Nona C. Flores explains, \"By the tenth century, artists were increasingly bound by allegorical interpretation, and abandoned naturalistic depictions.\"\n\nThe rationale for why people told these tales and rendered animals in such an imaginative way must be considered in order to gain a more complete understanding of these legendary creatures. When considering the idea of magic in medieval minds, historian Richard Kieckhefer explains, \"Magic is not meant to work but to express wishes, or to encode in symbols a perception of how things do or should work.\"  Medieval attempts to understand nature were not typically parallel to modern efforts. It was likely not the goal of people in the Middle Ages to depict their world for what it was materially, but rather what it could represent conceptually.\n", "context_len": 1094, "questions": ["How many mythical creatures represent years in the Chinese Zodiac?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Apple Blossom", "Appleblossom", "Green Apples", "Malus domesticus", "Appleblossoms", "Culture of apple", "Malus domestica", "Apple blossom", "Apple/Nutritional information", "Nutritional information about the apple", "Apple production", "Apple-blossoms", "Apple blossoms", "Apple peel", "An apple a day", "Apple (fruit)", "Apple trees", "Malus pumila", "Malus communis", "Pyrus malus", "Apple tree", "\ud83c\udf4f", "\ud83c\udf4e", "Apple Popularity", "Apples", "Dried apple", "\u0633\u06ce\u0648", "Apple (Fruit)", "Green Apple", "Apple-tree", "Green apples", "Apple", "Apples and teachers", "Aplle", "Apple-blossom", "Apple (tree)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

Later he became Chairman and Managing Director of the British Vacuum Cleaner and Engineering Co.\n\nEarly life\n\nBooth was born in Paris, France, although his family moved to Gloucester when he was 2 months old. He was educated at Gloucester College and Gloucester County School under headmaster Reverend H. Lloyed Brereton. In 1889 he entered the Central Technical College, City and Guild, London  after passing the entrance examination. He completed a three-year course in civil engineering and  mechanical engineering under Professor William Cawthorne Unwin FRS. He completed the Diploma of Associateship (ACGI), coming second in the engineering department. He became a student of the Institution of Civil Engineers.\n\nCareer\n\nIn December 1892 he entered the drawing office of Messrs Maudslay Sons & Field, Lambeth, London under Mr Charles Sells, as a civil engineer. In this capacity he designed bridges and large ferris wheels for amusement parks in London, Blackpool, Paris, and Vienna.\n\nHe worked on the design of engines for Royal Navy battleships. After seeing a rather inadequate demonstration of a compressed air based cleaning system for railway carriages at St Pancras station, Booth reasoned that sucking air through a filter might be a better system, and thus invented an early version of the vacuum cleaner which was manufactured by Fielding & Platt of Gloucester.\n His approach was better suited for industrial use than for household use, and his company was soon overtaken by his competitor, Hoover. He received British patents for his work on February 18 and August 30, 1901, and his company continued to specialize in industrial vacuum cleaners. Before Booth introduced his version of the vacuum cleaner, cleaning machines blew or brushed dirt away, instead of sucking it up. All modern vacuums are based on Booth's principle.\n\nPersonal life\n\nBooth married one of the daughters of Francis Tring Pearce, director of the Priday, Metford and Company Limited. He was a friend of Hugh Pembroke Vowles.

{"context": "\nSmelling salts\nSmelling salts, also known as ammonia inhalants, spirit of hartshorn or sal volatile, are chemical compounds used for arousing consciousness.\n\nUsage\n\nThe usual active compound is ammonium carbonate\u2014a colorless-to-white, crystalline solid ((NH4)2CO3).  Because most modern solutions are mixed with water, they should more properly be called \"aromatic spirits of ammonia.\"  Modern solutions may also contain other products to perfume or act in conjunction with the ammonia, such as lavender oil or eucalyptus oil. \n\nHistorically, smelling salts have been used on people feeling faint,    or who have fainted.  They are usually administered by others, but may be self-administered; some at-risk groups, such as pregnant women, may be advised to keep them close to hand. \n\nSmelling salts are often used on athletes (particularly boxers) who have been dazed or knocked unconscious to restore consciousness and mental alertness. Smelling salts are now banned in most boxing competitions.\n\nThey are also used as a form of stimulant in athletic competitions (such as powerlifting, strong man and ice hockey) to \"wake up\" competitors to perform better.  Athletes such as Vladimir Tarasenko, Phil Kessel, Alexander Ovechkin, Tyler Seguin, Sean Monahan, Derick Brassard, Keith Kinkaid, Ilya Kovalchuk, Brett Favre, Peyton Manning, Carlos Boozer, Samuel Eto'o, David Desharnais, Greg Hardy, Johnny Gaudreau and Tom Brady have been seen using smelling salts on the sidelines.    \n\nHistory\n\nSmelling salts have been used since Roman times and are mentioned in the writings of Pliny as Hammoniacus sal. Evidence exists of use in the 13th century by alchemists as sal ammoniac.\nIn the 17th century, the distillation of an ammonia solution from shavings of harts' (deer) horns and hooves led to the alternative name for smelling salts as spirit or salt of hartshorn.\n\nThey were widely used in Victorian Britain to revive fainting women, and in some areas constables would carry a container of them for the purpose.  During this time, smelling salts were commonly dissolved with perfume in vinegar or alcohol and soaked onto a sponge, which was then carried on the person in a decorative container called a vinaigrette. \n\nThe use of smelling salts was widely recommended during the Second World War, with all workplaces advised by the British Red Cross and St. John Ambulance to keep smelling salts in their first aid boxes. \n\nPhysiological action\n\nSmelling salts release ammonia (NH3) gas, which triggers an inhalation reflex (that is, cause the muscles that control breathing to work faster) by irritating the mucous membranes of the nose and lungs. Additionally, the irritant elevates the heart rate, blood pressure, and brain activity by activating the sympathetic nervous system. Fainting can be caused by excessive parasympathetic and vagal activity that slows the heart, and decreases perfusion of the brain.  The sympathetic irritant effect is exploited to counteract these vagal parasympathetic effects and thereby reverse the faint. \n\nRisks\n\nAmmonia gas is toxic in large concentrations for prolonged periods and can be fatal. Since smelling salts produce only a small amount of ammonia gas, no adverse health problems from their situational use have been reported.  However, a high concentration of inhaled ammonia might burn the nasal or oral mucosa.\n\nThe use of ammonia smelling salts to revive people injured during sport is not recommended because it may inhibit or delay a proper and thorough neurological assessment by a healthcare professional, such as after concussions when hospitalization may be advisable, and some governing bodies recommend specifically against it.    The irritant nature of smelling salts means that they can exacerbate any pre-existing cervical spine injury by causing reflex withdrawal away from them.\n", "context_len": 676, "questions": ["What is the active ingredient in smelling salts?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["John Gorman (disambiguation)", "JOHN GORMAN", "John Gorman", "Gorman, John"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nWhen Eight Bells Toll (film)\nWhen Eight Bells Toll is a 1971 action film set in Scotland, based upon Scottish author Alistair MacLean's 1965 novel of the same name. Producer Elliott Kastner planned to produce a string of realistic gritty espionage thrillers to rival the James Bond series, but the film's poor box office receipts ended his plans.\n\nPlot\n\nBritish Treasury secret agent Phillip Calvert (Anthony Hopkins) is sent to investigate the hijacking of five cargo ships in the Irish Sea, tracking the latest hijacked ship\u2014the Nantesville, carrying \u00a38 million in gold bullion\u2014to the Scottish Highlands and the sleepy port town of \"Torbay\" on the \"Isle of Torbay\" (patterned after Tobermory, on the Isle of Mull). \n\nPosing as marine biologists, Calvert and his partner Hunslett (Corin Redgrave) find the local inhabitants suspicious and hostile. They suspect that Cypriot tycoon and shipping magnate Sir Anthony Skouras (Jack Hawkins), whose luxury yacht Shangri-La is anchored off the coast, may be behind the pirating of the gold bullion. While searching the surrounding area in a Royal Navy Helicopter, Calvert makes contact with a group of remote shark fishermen who appear more friendly than Torbay's locals. Calvert also meets the occupants of a Castle, Lord Kirkside and his teenage daughter, who behave strangely as well as being hostile. \n\nAs the helicopter brings Calvert back to Torbay it comes under attack from the shore and the Royal Navy pilot is killed. The helicopter crashes, explodes and plummets into the sea. Calvert escapes from the helicopter after it sinks to the bottom. When he returns to his research yacht Firecrest he finds Hunslett is missing.\n\nOperating out of his yacht, Calvert is joined by his boss Sir Arthur Arnford-Jones, known as \"Uncle Arthur\" (Robert Morley). Together, they combat boarders and make ready for sea. On raising the anchor they find the dead body of Hunslett tied to it.\n\nThey are joined by Skouras's wife, Charlotte (Nathalie Delon), and when a pirate speedboat approaches, Calvert rams it, shoots the occupants and blows up the boat in vengeance for Hunslett's death.\n\nCalvert recruits the shark fishermen to deal with Skouras and his modern day pirates. Guessing that the missing bullion ships are being sunk to allow the gold to be offloaded invisibly, Calvert dives in the bay and finds the Nantesville. He fights and kills one of the divers, whom he has previously encountered and who he suspects killed Hunslett.\n\nHe then secretly enters Kirkside's castle and questions the Lord's daughter, discovering that Skouras is an innocent victim whose real wife is being held hostage along with other locals down in the castle's dungeons. He then sneaks into the underground dock of the castle where the gold is being offloaded.\n\nAt midnight (eight bells) the shark fishermen ram the gates of the underground dock with their boat. The pirates are expecting them because Charlotte has been transmitting Calvert's plans to them by secret radio. A fire fight ensues in which the pirates are wiped out, after which Calvert lets Charlotte escape with a single bar of gold in her possession.\n\nCast\n\n*Anthony Hopkins as Philip Calvert\n*Robert Morley as Uncle Arthur\n*Nathalie Delon as Charlotte\n*Jack Hawkins as Sir Anthony Skouras\n*Corin Redgrave as Hunslett\n*Derek Bond as Lord Charnley\n*Ferdy Mayne as Lavorski\n*Maurice Ro\u00ebves as Helicopter Pilot\n*Leon Collins as Tim Hutchinson\n*Wendy Allnutt as Sue Kirkside\n*Peter Arne as Imrie\n*Oliver MacGreevy as Quinn\n*Tom Chatto as Lord Kirkside\n*Edward Burnham as Macullum\n*Charles Gray uncredited voice of Sir Anthony Skouras\n\nProduction\n\nFilm rights to the novel were bought by the producing team of Elliot Kastner and Jerry Gershwin in 1966. They announced they would make the film as part of a 14-film slate over two years. Among the 14 movies were Maclean's Where Eagles Dare, which was a big hit in 1968, leading to high expectations for When Eight Bells Toll. \n\nMacLean elected to adapt his novel for the cinema himself, and kept the adaptation close to the novel. The story is very close to the source text, and features some of the same witty dialogue. Some of the twists in the ending have been changed, however, and a shootout replaces MacLean's original Agatha Christie-style summation.\n\nProducer Elliott Kastner hoped that the film would be the first of a series of spy adventures films featuring MacLean's Philip Calvert character by capturing James Bond series fans after the anticipated demise of that series (Sean Connery was believed to be planning to quit the Bond role, and some thought that the Bond series would end after his departure). \n\nKastner considered Michael Jayston and Anthony Hopkins for the role of Calvert. Hopkins, then best known as a stage actor for his work at the National Theatre was chosen.  Hopkins says he turned down the role at first, worried about being an action star. \"It seemed too fast for me,\" he said. \"I could hear myself saying, 'Now wait a minute'. Then when I had finally overcome my fright I said to myself 'I'd be mad to turn this chance down.'

{"context": "\nBlack Lady\nBlack Lady is an extremely combative variant of the card game Whist that is popular in the United Kingdom and is similar to the North American game Hearts. It is commonly played among large groups of players, typically 8 to 10, using two decks of cards, or it can be played by as few as three players using a single deck.\n\nMain rules\n\n#The game proceeds by trick-taking in the standard way, and there are no trumps.\n#Certain cards are listed as penalty cards, and have assigned penalty values.  When a trick is taken which contains any penalty cards, the winner of the trick is penalised by the total number of these penalty points.  Penalty points are counted at the end of each hand, and each player's running total of penalty points is adjusted as appropriate.\n#If one player takes every penalty card in the pack, called 'going for the lot', he can choose to do one of two things; either zeroise his running penalty total, or double everyone else's.\n\nThe penalty cards are :\n*Queen of Spades: 50 points (hence 'Black Lady')\n*Ace of Spades: 40 points\n*Ten of Spades: 20 points\n*Heart face cards: 10 points (this includes the Ace)\n*All other Hearts: face value\n\nThere are therefore 205 points to be taken per deck, per hand. One variant makes the 10 worth 15 points, so the total is exactly 200.\n\nOther rules\n\nThe cards are dealt out evenly among all the players, using standard Whist conventions for rotating dealership and lead.  This requires that the number of cards in play is divisible by the number of players, so before any hands are dealt, the pack(s) is inspected and the appropriate number of innocuous cards of trivial denomination (low Diamonds/Clubs) are extracted and discarded.\n\nWhen multiple packs are in use, there are multiple cards of each face. When the winning card face in a trick is played multiple times to that trick, the first such card played is the one which takes the trick.\n\nAfter the deal and before the first lead, each player must select three of his dealt cards and pass them covertly to his left-hand neighbour, and then accept three cards from his right-hand neighbour.

{"context": "\nMawashi\nIn sumo, a  is the belt (loincloth) that the rikishi (or sumo wrestler) wears during training or in competition.  Upper ranked professional wrestlers wear a kesh\u014d-mawashi (see below) as part of the ring entry ceremony or dohy\u014d-iri.\n\nMawashi\n\nFor top ranked professional rikishi, it is made of silk and comes in a variety of colours.  It is approximately 30 ft in length when unwrapped, about two feet wide and weighs about 8 to.  It is wrapped several times around the rikishi and fastened in the back by a large knot. A series of matching colour, stiffened silk fronds, called sagari are inserted into the front of the mawashi. Their number varies from 13 to 25, and is always an odd number. They are purely decorative, and if they fall out during competition the gy\u014dji (referee) will throw them from the ring at the first opportunity.\n\nSometimes a rikishi may wear his mawashi in such a way as to give him some advantage over his opponent. He may wear it loosely to make it more difficult to be thrown, or he may wrap it tightly and splash a little water on it to help prevent his opponent from getting a good grip on it. His choice will depend on the type of techniques he prefers to employ in his bouts. Thus a wrestler preferring belt sumo will usually wear it more loosely, while those preferring pushing techniques will tend to wear the mawashi more tightly.\n\nMany rikishi are superstitious and they will change the color of their mawashi to change their luck.  Sometimes a poor performance will cause them to change colors for the next tournament, or even during a tournament, in an attempt to change their luck for the better.\n\nRikishi only wear the silk mawashi during competitive bouts either during ranking tournaments or touring displays. During training, a heavy cotton mawashi is worn.  For senior rikishi in the top two divisions (the so-called sekitori), this belt is coloured white, and it is worn with one end distinctively looped at the front. Sagari are not worn during training.\n\nRikishi ranked in the lower divisions wear a black cotton mawashi both for training in and in competition.  In competition cotton sagari are inserted into the belt, but these are not stiffened.\n\nAmateur sumo wrestlers are expected to wear a white cotton mawashi without the looping accorded to the senior professional's training garb.\n\nIf a wrestler's mawashi comes off during a tournament bout, he is automatically disqualified.  This is extremely rare, but it did occur in May 2000 when sandanme wrestler Asanokiri was embarrassed during a match with Chiyohakuh\u014d.  However, for most of sumo's history, whether or not a wrestler's mawashi came off during a bout was considered irrelevant, and the policy of disqualification only came into place when Japan began adopting European attitudes towards nudity.\n\nKesh\u014d-mawashi\n\nWrestlers in the two upper divisions, makuuchi and j\u016bry\u014d, are allowed to wear a second ceremonial kesh\u014d-mawashi during their ring entering ceremony. The silk 'belt' opens out at one end into a large apron which is usually heavily embroidered and with thick tassels at the bottom. The kesh\u014d-mawashi may advertise the produce of a sponsor of the rikishi (for example Bulgarian \u014dzeki Koto\u014dsh\u016b was sponsored by a Japanese brand of yogurt, \"Bulgaria\", which was prominently displayed on the front of his kesh\u014d-mawashi) or be a gift from one of the rikishis support groups. Alternatively, some foreign-born rikishi (such as Czech-born Takanoyama) bear their national flag on their kesh\u014d-mawashi. Popular rikishi may be given many of these kesh\u014d-mawashi.\n\nYokozuna have matching sets of three kesh\u014d-mawashi, with two being worn by his wrestler assistants (his tachimochi and tsuyuharai) during his ring entrance ceremony.\n\nIn the Edo period the kesh\u014d-mawashi also served as the wrestler's fighting mawashi. However, as the aprons become more ornate, eventually the two functions were split apart. In this period wrestlers were normally sponsored by feudal daimy\u014d or overlords, whose clan crest would therefore appear on the kesh\u014d-mawashi.\n", "context_len": 751, "questions": ["In which sport do participants use a mawashi?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Christ Church", "Christ Church (disambiguation)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nConvention (norm)\nA convention is a set of agreed, stipulated, or generally accepted standards, norms, social norms, or criteria, often taking the form of a custom.\n\nCertain types of rules or customs may become law and regulatory legislation may be introduced to formalize or enforce the convention (for example, laws that define on which side of the road vehicles must be driven). In a social context, a convention may retain the character of an \"unwritten law\" of custom (for example, the manner in which people greet each other, such as by shaking each other's hands).\n\nIn physical sciences, numerical values (such as constants, quantities, or scales of measurement) are called conventional if they do not represent a measured property of nature, but originate in a convention, for example an average of many measurements, agreed between the scientists working with these values.\n\nGeneral \n\nA convention is a selection from among two or more alternatives, where the rule or alternative is agreed upon among participants. Often the word refers to unwritten customs shared throughout a community. For instance, it is conventional in many societies that strangers being introduced shake hands. Some conventions are explicitly legislated; for example, it is conventional in the United States and in Germany that motorists drive on the right side of the road, whereas in New Zealand and the United Kingdom motorists drive on the left. The standardization of time is a human convention based on the solar cycle or calendar. The extent to which justice is conventional (as opposed to natural or objective) is historically an important debate among philosophers.\n\nThe nature of conventions has raised long-lasting philosophical discussion. Quine, Davidson, and David Lewis published influential writings on the subject. Lewis's account of convention received an extended critique in Margaret Gilbert's On Social Facts (1989), where an alternative account is offered. Another view of convention comes from Ruth Millikan's Language:  A Biological Model (2005), once more against Lewis.\n\nAccording to David Kalupahana, The Buddha described conventions \u2014 whether linguistic, social, political, moral, ethical, or even religious \u2014 as arising dependent on specific conditions. According to his paradigm, when conventions are considered absolute realities, they contribute to dogmatism, which in turn leads to conflict. This does not mean that conventions should be absolutely ignored as unreal and therefore useless. Instead, according to Buddhist thought, a wise person adopts a middle way without holding conventions to be ultimate or ignoring them when they are fruitful. \n\nCustomary or social conventions \n\nSocial \n\nIn sociology a social rule refers to any social convention commonly adhered to in a society. These rules are not written in law or otherwise formalized. In social constructionism there is a great focus on social rules. It is argued that these rules are socially constructed, that these rules act upon every member of a society, but at the same time, are re-produced by the individuals.\n\nSociologists representing symbolic interactionism argue that social rules are created through the interaction between the members of a society. The focus on active interaction highlights the fluid, shifting character of social rules. These are specific to the social context, a context that varies through time and place. That means a social rule changes over time within the same society. What was acceptable in the past may no longer be the case. Similarly, rules differ across space: what is acceptable in one society may not be so in another.\n\nSocial rules reflect what is acceptable or normal behaviour in any situation. Michel Foucault's concept of discourse is closely related to social rules as it offers a possible explanation how these rules are shaped and change. It is the social rules that tell people what is normal behaviour for any specific category. Thus, social rules tell a woman how to behave in a womanly manner, and a man, how to be manly. Other such rules are as follows:\n\n*Strangers being introduced shake hands, as in Western societies, but\n**Bow toward each other, in Korea, Japan and China\n**Do not bow at each other, in the Jewish tradition\n**In the United States, eye contact, a nod of the head toward each other, and a smile, with no bowing; the palm of the hand faces sideways, neither upward nor downward, in a business handshake.\n**Present business cards to each other, in business meetings\n*Click heels together, in past eras of Western history\n*A woman's curtsey, in some societies\n*In the Middle East, never displaying the sole of the foot toward another, as this would be seen as a grave insult.\n*In many schools, though seats for students are not assigned they are still \"claimed\" by certain students, and sitting in someone else's seat is considered an insult\n\nGovernment \n\nIn government, convention is a set of unwritten rules that participants in the government must follow. These rules can be ignored only if justification is clear, or can be provided. Otherwise, consequences follow. Consequences may include ignoring some other convention that has until now been followed. According to the traditional doctrine (Dicey), conventions cannot be enforced in courts, because they are non-legal sets of rules. Convention is particularly important in the Westminster System of government, where many of the rules are unwritten.\n\nInternational law \n\nThe term \"convention\" is also used in international law to refer to certain formal statements of principle such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Conventions are adopted by international bodies such as the International Labour Organization and the United Nations. Conventions so adopted usually apply only to countries that ratify them, and do not automatically apply to member states of such bodies. These conventions are generally seen as having the force of international treaties for the ratifying countries. The best known of these are perhaps the several Geneva Conventions.\n", "context_len": 1119, "questions": ["The conventional symbol for electrical current is?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Steel", "Steel workers", "Steel plate", "Steel truss", "Steelworker", "Steel (alloy)", "Steel industry", "STEEL", "Steel (metal)", "Steels", "Titanic steel", "Steelworkers", "Steel in Africa", "Steel sheeting", "Crude steel", "Steel worker", "Unwrapped steel", "Long steel products", "Steel Construction", "Steel manufacture"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nBaileys Women's Prize for Fiction\nThe Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction (previously called Women's Prize for Fiction (2013), Orange Prize for Fiction (1996\u20132006 and 2009\u201312) and Orange Broadband Prize for Fiction (2007\u201308)) is one of the United Kingdom's most prestigious literary prizes.   It is awarded annually to a female author of any nationality for the best original full-length novel written in English and published in the United Kingdom in the preceding year. \n\nHistory\n\nThe prize was established to recognise the literary achievement of female writers.   The inspiration for the Baileys Prize was the Booker Prize of 1991, when none of the six shortlisted books was by a woman, despite some 60% of novels published that year being by female authors.  A group of women and men working in the industry \u2013 authors, publishers, agents, booksellers, librarians, journalists \u2013 therefore met to discuss the issue. Research showed that women\u2019s literary achievements were often not acknowledged by the major literary prizes.\n\nThe winner of the prize receives \u00a330,000, along with a bronze sculpture called the Bessie created by artist Grizel Niven, the sister of actor and writer David Niven.   Typically, a longlist of nominees is announced around March each year, followed by a shortlist in June; within days the winner is announced.  The winner is selected by a board of \"five leading women\" each year. \n\nThe prize has \"spawned\" several sub-category competitions and awards: the Harper's Bazaar Broadband Short Story Competition, the Orange Award for New Writers, the Penguin/Orange Readers' Group Prize, and the Reading Book Group of the Year.  \n\nIn support of the 2004 award, the Orange Prize for Fiction published a list of 50 contemporary \"essential reads\". The books were chosen by a sample of 500 people attending the Guardian Hay Festival and represent the audience's \"must have\" books by living UK writers. The list is called the Orange Prize for Fiction's \"50 Essential Reads by Contemporary Authors\". \n\nThe prize was originally sponsored by Orange, a telecommunications company. In May 2012, it was announced Orange would be ending its corporate sponsorship of the prize.  There was no corporate sponsor for 2013; sponsorship was by \"private benefactors\", led by Cherie Blair and writers Joanna Trollope and Elizabeth Buchan.\n\nBeginning in 2014, the prize was sponsored by the liquor brand Baileys Irish Cream. \n\nWinners and shortlisted writers\n\n#ThisBook\n\nIn May 2014, Baileys Women's Prize for Fiction launched the #ThisBook campaign to find out which books, written by women, have had the biggest impact on readers.  Nineteen \"inspirational women\" were chosen to launch the campaign and then thousands of people from the \"general public\" submitted their ideas via Twitter. The 20 winners were announced 29 July 2014. The organizers noted that over half the winning books were published before 1960.\n\n#To Kill a Mockingbird, Harper Lee\n#The Handmaid's Tale, Margaret Atwood\n#Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte\n#Harry Potter, J.K Rowling\n#Wuthering Heights, Emily Bronte\n#Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen\n#Rebecca, Daphne Du Maurier\n#Little Women, Louisa May Alcott\n#The Secret History, Donna Tartt\n#I Capture The Castle, Dodie Smith\n#The Bell Jar, Sylvia Plath\n#Beloved, Toni Morrison\n#Gone With The Wind, Margaret Mitchell\n#We Need To Talk About Kevin, Lionel Shriver\n#The Time Traveller's Wife, Audrey Niffenegger\n#Middlemarch, George Eliot\n#I Know Why The Caged Bird Sings, Maya Angelou\n#The Golden Notebook, Doris Lessing\n#The Colour Purple, Alice Walker\n#The Women's Room, Marilyn French\n\nCriticism\n\nThe fact that the prize excludes male writers has provoked comment.  After the prize was founded, Auberon Waugh nicknamed it the \"Lemon Prize,\" while Germaine Greer said there would soon be a prize for \"writers with red hair\".   A. S. Byatt, who won the 1990 Man Booker Prize, said it was a \"sexist prize\", claiming \"such a prize was never needed\". She refused to have her work considered for this prize.  In 2007, former editor of The Times Simon Jenkins called the prize \"sexist\".  In 2008, writer Tim Lott suggested \"the Orange Prize is sexist and discriminatory, and it should be shunned\".  \n\nOn the other hand, in 2011 London journalist Jean Hannah Edelstein wrote about her own \"wrong reasons\" for supporting the prize: \n\"Unfortunately, the evidence shows that the experiences of male and female writers after they set their pens down are often distinctively different. That's why I've changed my mind about the Orange prize. I still agree with Byatt that the idea of female-specific subject matter is spurious, but I don't think that's what the prize rewards.\" In 2012 Cynthia Ozick, writing in The New York Times, said the Prize \"was not born into an innocent republic of letters\" when it comes to a history of women writers being discriminated against. She concluded, \"For readers and writers, in sum, the more prizes the better, however they are structured, and philosophy be damned.\" \n\nIn 1999 Lola Young, chair of the judges panel, claimed that British female literature fell into two categories, either \"insular and parochial\" or \"domestic in a piddling kind of way\".  Linda Grant suffered accusations of plagiarism following her award in 2000. In 2001 a panel of male critics strongly criticised the Orange shortlist and produced its own.  In 2007, broadcaster Muriel Gray, chair of the panel, said that judges had to wade through \"a lot of dross\" to get to the shortlist, but praised that year's winner, Half of a Yellow Sun by Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, saying, \"This is a moving and important book by an incredibly exciting author.\" .\n", "context_len": 1111, "questions": ["Which novelist whose original first names were Margaret Ann before she changed them, won the 2005 Orange Prize for the book 'We Need To Talk About Kevin'?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Whey powder", "Milk plasma", "Whey cream", "Acid whey", "Whey Allergy", "Whey allergy", "Lactoserum", "Whey", "Sweet whey", "Milk permeate", "Sour whey"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nElizabeth Cellier\nElizabeth Cellier (commonly known as Mrs. Cellier and dubbed the \"Popish Midwife\"), flourished 1668\u20131688, London, England, was a notable Catholic midwife in seventeenth-century England. She stood trial for treason in 1679 for her alleged part in the \"Meal-Tub Plot\" against the future James II but was acquitted. She later became a pamphleteer and made attempts to advance the field of midwifery.\n\nLife\n\nElizabeth Cellier was a noted London midwife, who came into prominence through the pretended \"Meal-Tub Plot\" of 1680. Nothing seems known of her life until her marriage with Peter Cellier, a Frenchman, and her conversion from Anglicanism.\n\nIn 1678 the prisons were filled with Catholics in consequence of the national alarm caused by the fabricated plots of Titus Oates. Mrs. Cellier's charity led her to visit and relieve these prisoners, and as her profession procured for her the acquaintance of many leading Catholic ladies, she often became the channel of their charity towards the prisoners. Among these ladies was the Countess of Powis, whose kindness was shown to, among others, a clever imposter, Thomas Dangerfield. Becoming aware of this man's true character, Lady Powis ceased to assist him further, and he, in revenge, decided to denounce her to the government as concerned in a new Popish Plot.\n\nDangerfield's story was that he had been released from prison through the good offices of Lady Powis and Mrs. Cellier on condition that he assassinate the king, Lord Shaftesbury, and others. He further pretended that he was to be engaged in manufacturing false plots to be foisted on those who were known to be unfavourable to the Catholic cause. One of these shams was to be based on a document which, he alleged, was hidden in a meal-tub in Mrs. Cellier's house. A search was made, and the paper in question was found in a meal-tub. It charged with treason most of the leading Protestants, including the king's natural son, the Duke of Monmouth, the Earl of Shaftesbury, and Sir Thomas Waller, who was the very official charged with the search. Lady Powis and Mrs. Cellier were arrested, as were some other Catholics, among them the Earl of Castlemaine.\n\nMrs. Cellier's trial took place on 11 June 1680. She was charged with high treason, but practically the only evidence against her was that of Dangerfield himself, and she had little difficulty in proving him a witness entirely unworthy of credence. She was found not guilty, and Dangerfield himself was arrested on account of a felony, for which he had been previously outlawed. After her acquittal, she published a brief relation of the whole affair, under the title of \"Malice Defeated\" in 1680. Dangerfield, while undergoing a public whipping in 1685, was accidentally killed in a scuffle with a barrister, Robert Francis.\n\nThe publication of Malice Defeated led not only to a long series of pamphlets for and against her, but also to her second prosecution. The charge this time was that of libel against the king and ministry, because she alleged that two witnesses in the Edmund Berry Godfrey case had been tortured. The real object of this prosecution, according to Roger North, was to prevent her from giving evidence in favour of the imprisoned Catholic peers. For this, she was sentenced to pay a fine of \u00a31,000 and to stand three times in the pillory.\n\nDuring the reign of James II, she proposed the foundation of a corporation of skilled midwives and a foundling hospital. The fees would be used to set up parish houses where any woman could give birth. It is stated that she is buried in Great Missenden Church, Buckinghamshire.\n\nWorks\n\nShe wrote:\n*\"Malice Defeated; or a brief relation of the Accusation and Deliverance of Elizabeth Cellier\" (London, 1680);\n*\"A scheme for the Foundation of a Royal Hospital and raising a revenue of \u00a35000 or \u00a36000 a year by and for the maintenance of a Corporation of skilful midwives\" (London, 1687), printed in the \"Harleian Miscellany\" (IV, 142) and in Somers Tracts (II, 243);\n*\"To Dr. ______, An answer to his Queries concerning the College of Midwives\" (London, 1687\u201388).\n\nNotes\n", "context_len": 806, "questions": ["The 17th Century \u2018Meal Tub Plot\u2019 was against which future king of England?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Hartford.", "Hartford CT", "Hartford, Connecticut", "City of Hartford, Connecticut", "Hartford (Connecticut)", "Hartford Connecticut", "Hartford, Conn.", "Hartford, Ct.", "Hartford ct", "Hartford, USA", "Hartford, cn", "Hartford", "Hartford,CT", "Hartford, CT", "Capital of Connecticut", "Hartford, ct", "Hartford, Hartford County, Connecticut", "Hartford, Ct", "Hartford (CT)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

West won just three England caps in an age when good goalkeepers came easy not just for England, but also the other home nations (well, Scotland perhaps did have a problem or two).\nWest was a flamboyant keeper and rarely made a mistake, but he had a string of players to competitors to contend with: Gordon Banks, Peter Bonetti, Alex Stepney, the Springetts, Jim Montgomery and the rising star that was Peter Shilton. Almost all clubs had a decent keeper. And this was also an age where the incomparable Pat Jennings \u2013 he of the huge hands \u2013 was turning out for Northern Ireland and the haphazard \u2013 but occasionally brilliant \u2013 Gary Sprake was between the sticks for Wales.\nWest\u2019s England career saw him concede two goals in three games, and included a 0-0 draw in Mexico a year before the 1970 World Cup. He declined the offer of a place in the England squad for that competition and that was the end of his international career. He had been a key figure in Everton\u2019s 1969-70 title win, keeping 21 clean sheets.\nIn any other age, West would have won dozens of caps. English goalkeepers are at a premium today \u2013 witness the very average players who represent their country. Joe Hart is good enough and should claim the shirt for years to come, but he has little competition.

{"context": "\nParamaribo\nParamaribo (, nickname: Par\u2032bo) is the capital and largest city of Suriname, located on the banks of the Suriname River in the Paramaribo District. Paramaribo has a population of roughly 240,000 people (2012 census), almost half of Suriname's population. The historic inner city of Paramaribo has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2002.\n\nName \n\nThe city is named for the Paramaribo tribe living at the mouth of the Suriname River; the name is from Tupi-Guarani para \"large river\" + maribo \"inhabitants\". \n\nHistory \n\nThe area, a trading post started by the Dutch, was taken by the English in 1630, and in 1650 the city became the capital of the new English colony. The area changed hands often between the English and Dutch but it was in Dutch hands again in 1667 and under Dutch rule from 1815 until the independence of Suriname in 1975.\n\nParamaribo is home to a historic Jewish community.  One of the oldest synagogues in the Americas is located in Paramaribo. It was built in 1685 near the Suriname River.\n\nIn January 1821, a fire in the city centre destroyed more than 400 houses and other buildings. A second fire in September 1832 destroyed another 46 houses on the western part of the Waterkant.\n\nIn 1943 a military plane crashed on its way to North Africa near the city, killing two FBI Agents and 33 other people who were on board. The cause of the aircraft accident was never determined and very few remains of the 35 people aboard were found. \n\nGeography \n\nThe city is located on the Suriname River, approximately 15 km inland from the Atlantic Ocean, in the Paramaribo district.\n\nFile:Kaart van Paramaribo.png|Paramaribo around 1737.\nFile:Platte grond van de stad Paramaribo (1821).jpg|Paramaribo in 1821.

The city has no true dry season, all 12 months of the year average more than 60\u00a0mm of precipitation, but the city does experience noticeably wetter and drier periods during the year. September through November is the driest period of the year in Paramaribo. Common to many cities with this climate, temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the course of the year, with average high temperatures of 31 degrees Celsius and average low temperatures of 22 degrees Celsius. Paramaribo on average sees roughly 2200\u00a0mm of rain each year.\n\nDemographics \n\nParamaribo has a population of 240,924 people (2012 census). The city is famed for its diverse ethnic makeup, including Creoles (African or African-European descent) 27%, Indian (East Indian descent) 23%, Multiracials 18%, Maroons (descendants of escaped African slaves) 16%, Javanese (Indonesian descent) 10%, Indigenous (descendants of native population) 2%, Chinese (descendants of 19th-century contract workers) 1.5%, and smaller numbers of Europeans (primarily of Dutch and Portuguese descent), Lebanese and Jews. In the past decades a significant number of Brazilians, Guyanese and new Chinese immigrants have settled in Paramaribo.\n\nEconomy \n\nParamaribo is the business and financial centre of Suriname. Even though the capital city does not produce significant goods itself, almost all revenues from the country's main export products gold, oil, bauxite, rice, and tropical wood are channeled through its institutions. All banks, insurance corporations and other financial and commercial companies are headquartered in Paramaribo. Around 75 percent of Suriname's GDP is consumed in Paramaribo.\n\nTourism is an increasingly important sector, with most visitors coming from the Netherlands. \n\nGovernment \n\nAdministratively, Paramaribo forms its own district in Suriname. The resorts of Paramaribo district therefore correspond to boroughs of the city. There are twelve resorts in the Paramaribo district:\n\nTransport \n\nParamaribo is served by the Johan Adolf Pengel International Airport and Zorg en Hoop Airport for local flights. The Jules Wijdenbosch Bridge, which is part of the East-West Link, connects Paramaribo with Meerzorg on the other side of the Suriname River.\n\nMost airlines like Gum Air, Caricom Airways and Blue Wing Airlines have their head offices on the grounds of Zorg en Hoop Airport in Paramaribo.\n\nEducation \n\nParamaribo's institution of higher learning is Anton de Kom University of Suriname, the country's only university.\n\nHealthcare \n\nParamaribo is home to four hospitals, the Academic Hospital Paramaribo, 's Lands Hospitaal, Sint Vincentius Hospital and Diakonessenhuis.\n\nNotable landmarks \n\n*Suriname Mosque\n*National Assembly of Suriname\n*Neveh Shalom Synagogue\n*Roman Catholic St Peter and St Paul Cathedral\n*The Arya Dewaker Hindu Temple\n*Presidential Palace of Suriname Presidential Palace\n*Garden of Palms, a landscape garden of royal palms behind the presidential palace\n\nSports \n\nParamaribo is also the birthplace of several football players; some of them later represented the Netherlands:\n* Maarten Atmodikoro\n* Regi Blinker\n* Edson Braafheid\n* Romeo Castelen\n* Edgar Davids\n* Henk Fraser\n* Ulrich van Gobbel\n* Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink\n* Jerry de Jong\n* Kelvin Leerdam\n* Stanley Menzo\n* Herman Rijkaard\n* Clarence Seedorf\n* Andw\u00e9l\u00e9 Slory\n* Mark de Vries\n* Fabian Wilnis\n* Aron Winter\n\nOther sports such as badminton, tennis, swimming, track & field athletics, cycling, golf, volleyball and basketball are also commonly played in Suriname.\n\nParamaribo is also the birthplace of kickboxer and Mixed Martial Artist Tyrone Spong and kickboxer Andy Ristie.\n\nTwin towns \u2013 Sister cities\n\nParamaribo is twinned with:\n*  Antwerp, Belgium.\n*  Hangzhou, China.\n*  Georgetown, Guyana \n*  Willemstad, Cura\u00e7ao. \n*  Yogyakarta, Indonesia.\n", "context_len": 1052, "questions": ["Paramaribo is a city and port in which South American country?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["\u2121", "Fixed telephony", "\u2706", "Telephone receiver", "Fone", "Telpehone", "Telephone and Telephone System", "Telephone", "\u260f", "\u260e", "Phone", "\ud83d\udcde", "\u2315", "Telephones", "A phone", "Phones", "Telephone set", "Telephone bell", "Station set", "Telephone cord", "Telephone communication"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

Always complicated. That\u2019s why there are so many words to describe how two people (sometimes more) live and love together. Like polygamy.\nDo you remember the 2007\u00a0arrest of Warren Jeffs, a religious leader and polygamist on charges involving multiple marriages and underage girls? The case, and polygamy, are back in the news.\nThe Utah Supreme Court reversed the charges against Jeffs and ordered a new trial, saying the jury received improper instructions. The legal situation revives interest not just in polygamy but in all the different types of marriage and the words that describe the multiplicity of matrimony.\nPolygamy is \u201cthe practice or condition of having more than one spouse, esp. wife, at one time.\u201d Here\u2019s the important part: polygamy refers generally to multiple spouses or multiple marriages, not husbands or wives in particular. The opposite of polygamy is monogamy . Poly is the Greek root for \u201cmany.\u201d Mono is \u201cone.\u201d Gamos is \u201cmarriage.\u201d So these terms literally refer to \u201cmany or one marriage.\u201d Another common gamos term is bigamy , \u201cthe crime of marrying a person while one is still legally married to someone else.\u201d The bi- is Latin for \u201ctwo.\u201d\u00a0But here\u2019s one you may not know that complicates matters further: Digamy is what you call \u201ca second marriage, after the death or divorce of the first husband or wife.\u201d Di- can also mean \u201ctwo\u201d or \u201cdouble.\u201d\nIs this complicated enough yet? Because there\u2019s more nuptial nomenclature nonsense. It\u2019s a common misconception that polygamy means one man married to multiple wives. The real term for that arrangement is polygyny , \u201cthe practice or condition of having more than one wife at one time.\u201d Poly was defined above, and -gyny probably looks familar, from words like misogyny and gynecology : it\u2019s the Greek gyne, \u201cwoman.\u201d\nWhat about a woman\u00a0who has more than one husband\u00a0at one time? That\u2019s polyandry . ( Andro is Greek for \u201cman.\u201d)\nOur journey comes down to\u00a0a few\u00a0more words, one of which is quite controversial. amour in -amory. Tellingly, one definition of amour is \u201ca secret love affair.\u201d Polyamory cuts to a primal\u00a0concern about love, marriage and relationships: fidelity , and its counterpart, infidelity .\nOur last terms\u00a0are how\u00a0many people would describe with their relationships: monandry , \u201cthe practice or condition of having one husband\u00a0at a time,\u201d and monogyny , the same thing but regarding wives.\nWhat do these words say about your relationship and the state of marriage in general?\nPowerPoint Class: Orland Park Public Library, 14921 S.

{"context": "\nMarie Tussaud\nAnne-Marie \"Marie\" Tussaud (; n\u00e9e Grosholtz; 1 December 1761 \u2013 16 April 1850) was a French artist, who became known for her wax sculptures and Madame Tussauds, the wax museum she founded in London.\n\nBiography \n\nAt the age of six, after the death of her father, Tussaud moved into the home of Philippe Curtius, a doctor in Berne, Switzerland; for whom her mother acted as housekeeper. Curtius was a physician, and was skilled in wax modelling, which he used to illustrate anatomy and later for portraits.\n\nCurtius moved to Paris in 1765 to establish a Cabinet de Portraits En Cire (Cabinet of Portraits in Wax).  In that year, he made a waxwork of Louis XV's last mistress, Madame du Barry, a cast that is the oldest work currently on display. A year later, Tussaud and her mother joined Curtius in Paris. The first exhibition of Curtius' waxworks was shown in 1770 and attracted a large crowd. In 1776, the exhibition was moved to the Palais Royal and, in 1782, Curtius opened a second exhibit, the Caverne des Grands Voleurs (Cavern of the Grand Thieves), a precursor to Tussaud's Chamber of Horrors, on Boulevard du Temple.\n\nIt was Curtius who taught Tussaud the art of wax modeling. She showed talent for the technique and began working for him as an artist. In 1777, she created her first wax figure, that of Voltaire.  From 1780 until the Revolution in 1789, Tussaud created many of her most famous portraits of celebrities such as those of philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Benjamin Franklin. During this period her memoirs claim she became employed to teach votive making to \u00c9lisabeth, the sister of Louis XVI. In her memoirs, she admitted to be privy to private conversations between the princess and her brother and members of his court. She also claimed that members of the royal family were so pleased with her work that she was invited to live at Versailles for a period of 9 years.  Though no contemporary evidence confirm her accounts. \n\nFrench Revolution \n\nOn 12 July 1789, wax heads of Jacques Necker and the duc d'Orl\u00e9ans made by Curtius were carried in a protest march two days before the attack on the Bastille.\n\nTussaud was perceived as a royal sympathizer; in the Reign of Terror she was arrested, along with Jos\u00e9phine de Beauharnais, and her head was shaved in preparation for her execution by guillotine. She was released thanks to Collot d'Herbois' support for Curtius and his household. Tussaud was then employed to make death masks of the revolution's famous victims, including Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, Marat, and Robespierre. Her death masks were paraded through the streets of Paris, like revolutionary flags. Conflicting accounts argue over whether Tussaud sought through the dead to collect the most illustrious heads she could find, as stated in her memoirs.\n\nWhen Curtius died in 1794, he left his collection of wax works to Tussaud. In 1795, she married Fran\u00e7ois Tussaud, a civil engineer. The couple had three children, a daughter who died after birth, and two sons, Joseph and Fran\u00e7ois.\n\nGreat Britain \n\nIn 1802, after the Treaty of Amiens, Tussaud went to London with her son Joseph, then four years old, to present her collection of portraits. Having accepted an invitation from Paul Philidor, a magic lantern and phantasmagoria pioneer, to exhibit her work alongside his show at the Lyceum Theatre, London. She did not fare particularly well financially, with Philidor taking half of her profits.\n\nAs a result of the Napoleonic Wars, Tussaud was unable to return to France so she traveled with her collection throughout the British Isles. In 1822, she reunited with her other son, Fran\u00e7ois, who joined her in the family business. Her husband remained in France and the two never again saw each other. In 1835, after 33 years touring Britain, she established her first permanent exhibition in Baker Street, on the upper floor of the \"Baker Street Bazaar\".  In 1838, she wrote her memoirs. In 1842, she made a self-portrait which is now on display at the entrance of her museum. Some of the sculptures done by Tussaud herself still exist.\n\nShe died in her sleep in London on 16 April 1850 at the age of 88. There is a memorial tablet to Madame Marie Tussaud on the right side of the nave of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, Cadogan Street, London.\n\nLegacy \n\nUpon Marie Tussaud's retirement, her son Fran\u00e7ois (or Francis) became chief artist for the Exhibition. He was succeeded in turn by his son Joseph, who was succeeded by his son John Theodore Tussaud. \n\nMadame Tussaud's wax museum has now grown to become one of the major tourist attractions in London, and has expanded with branches in Amsterdam, Bangkok, Sydney, Madame Tussauds Hong Kong (Victoria Peak), Las Vegas, Shanghai, Berlin, Washington, D.C., New York City, Orlando, Hollywood and Singapore.

{"context": "\nNorwich South (UK Parliament constituency)\nNorwich South is a constituency in Norfolk represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was created for the 1950 general election.\n\nThe constituency is currently represented by Clive Lewis of the Labour Party. \n\nBoundaries\n\n1950-1974: The County Borough of Norwich wards of Ber Street, Conesford, Earlham, Eaton, Lakenham, Nelson, St Stephen, and Town Close.\n\n1974-1983: The County Borough of Norwich wards of Bowthorpe, Earlham, Eaton, Lakenham, Mancroft, Nelson, St Stephen, and Town Close.\n\n1983-1997: The City of Norwich wards of Bowthorpe, Eaton, Heigham, Henderson, Lakenham, Mancroft, Nelson, St Stephen, Thorpe Hamlet, Town Close, and University.\n\n1997-2010: The City of Norwich wards of Bowthorpe, Eaton, Heigham, Henderson, Lakenham, Mancroft, Nelson, St Stephen, Thorpe Hamlet, Town Close, and University; the District of Broadland ward of Brundall; and the District of South Norfolk wards of Cringleford and Colney, and New Costessey.\n\n2010\u2013present: The City of Norwich wards of Bowthorpe, Eaton, Lakenham, Mancroft, Nelson, Thorpe Hamlet, Town Close, University, and Wensum, and the District of South Norfolk ward of New Costessey.\n\nThe constituency is one of two covering the city of Norwich, the other being Norwich North.\n\n;2010 Changes\nFollowing their review of parliamentary constituencies in Norfolk that concluded in 2004, the Boundary Commission for England created a slightly modified Norwich South constituency. The changes took effect at the 2010 general election.\n \nChanges were necessary in order to re-align the constituency boundaries with the new local government ward boundaries introduced in South Norfolk and Norwich in 2003 and 2004 respectively. Norfolk also received an additional, ninth constituency, by the Boundary Commission. The part of the Crome ward around Morse Road became part of Norwich North, while the area around Mousehold Street in Thorpe Hamlet moved into Norwich South. The villages of Cringleford and Colney were lost to South Norfolk constituency. Brundall ward, which was from 1997 to 2010 within the boundaries of this constituency, went to the new seat of Broadland.\n\nHistory\n\nThe constituency was created for the 1950 general election, when the 2-seat Norwich constituency was divided into Norwich North and Norwich South.  The Labour MP for this seat from 1997 to 2010 was Charles Clarke who served in cabinet for five years from 2001 to 2006, first as Minister without Portfolio, then as Secretary of State for Education and Skills and latterly as Home Secretary.\n\nNorwich South was by far Labour's safest seat in Norfolk throughout the Thatcher years and up until 2005. Although it was lost to the Conservatives in 1983, it was regained by Labour in 1987 and was the only Labour seat in Norfolk until 1997. In 2005 the Labour majority was cut by over 5000 leaving Norwich North as the safest Labour seat in the county.\n\nThe seat was considered a true three way marginal in the 2010 election between the incumbent Labour party the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives. The seat was also targeted by the Green Party. The seat was won by the Liberal Democrats with the lowest percentage share of the vote in a constituency in the 2010 election.

{"context": "\nSteady State theory\nIn cosmology, the Steady State theory  is an alternative to the Big Bang model of the evolution of the universe. In the steady-state theory, the density of matter in the expanding universe remains unchanged due to a continuous creation of matter,  thus adhering to the perfect cosmological principle, a principle that asserts that the observable universe is basically the same at any time as well as at any place. \n\nWhile the steady state model enjoyed some popularity in the mid-20th century, it is now rejected by the vast majority of cosmologists, astrophysicists and astronomers, as the observational evidence points to a hot Big Bang cosmology with a finite age of the universe, which the Steady State model does not predict.  \n\nHistory\n\nCosmological expansion was originally discovered through observations by Edwin Hubble. Theoretical calculations also showed that the static universe as modeled by Einstein (1917) was unstable and contradicted general relativity. The modern Big Bang theory is one in which the universe has a finite age and has evolved over time through cooling, expansion, and the formation of structures through gravitational collapse.\n\nThe steady state theory asserts that although the universe is expanding, it nevertheless does not change its appearance over time (the perfect cosmological principle); the universe has no beginning and no end. This requires that matter be continually created in order to keep the universe's density from decreasing. Influential papers on steady state cosmologies were published by Hermann Bondi, Thomas Gold, and Fred Hoyle in 1948.  \n\nIt is now known that Albert Einstein considered a steady-state model of the expanding universe, as indicated in a 1931 manuscript, many years before Hoyle, Bondi and Gold. However, he quickly abandoned the idea. \n\nObservational tests\n\nCounts of radio sources\n\nProblems with the steady-state theory began to emerge in the 1950s and 60s, when observations began to support the idea that the universe was in fact changing: bright radio sources (quasars and radio galaxies) were found only at large distances (therefore could have existed only in the distant past), not in closer galaxies.  Whereas the Big Bang theory predicted as much, the Steady State theory predicted that such objects would be found throughout the universe, including close to our own galaxy. By 1961, statistical tests based on radio-source surveys  had ruled out the steady state model in the minds of most cosmologists, although some proponents of the steady state insisted that the radio data were suspect.\n\nCosmic microwave background\n\nFor most cosmologists, the definitive refutation of the steady-state theory came with the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation in 1965, which was predicted by the Big Bang theory. Stephen Hawking described this discovery as \"the final nail in the coffin of the steady-state theory.\"  The steady-state theory explained microwave background radiation as the result of light from ancient stars that has been scattered by galactic dust.  However, the cosmic microwave background level is very even in all directions, making it difficult to explain how it could be generated by numerous point sources and the microwave background radiation shows no evidence of characteristics such as polarization that are normally associated with scattering. Furthermore, its spectrum is so close to that of an ideal black body that it could hardly be formed by the superposition of contributions from a multitude of dust clumps at different temperatures as well as at different redshifts. Steven Weinberg wrote in 1972,\nThe steady state model does not appear to agree with the observed dL versus z relation or with source counts ... In a sense, this disagreement is a credit to the model; alone among all cosmologies, the steady-state model makes such definite predictions that it can be disproved even with the limited observational evidence at our disposal. The steady-state model is so attractive that many of its adherents still retain hope that the evidence against it will eventually disappear as observations improve. However, if the cosmic microwave radiation . . . is really black-body radiation, it will be difficult to doubt that the universe has evolved from a hotter denser early stage. \n\nSince this discovery, the Big Bang theory has been considered to provide the best explanation of the origin of the universe. In most astrophysical publications, the Big Bang is implicitly accepted and is used as the basis of more complete theories.\n\nQuasi-steady state\n\nQuasi-steady state cosmology (QSS) was proposed in 1993 by Fred Hoyle, Geoffrey Burbidge, and Jayant V. Narlikar as a new incarnation of the steady state ideas meant to explain additional features unaccounted for in the initial proposal. The theory suggests pockets of creation occurring over time within the universe, sometimes referred to as minibangs, mini-creation events, or little bangs.  After the observation of an accelerating universe, further modifications of the model were made. \n\nAstrophysicist and cosmologist Ned Wright has pointed out flaws in the theory.  These first comments were soon rebutted by the proponents.  Wright and other mainstream cosmologists reviewing QSS have pointed out new flaws and discrepancies with observations left unexplained by proponents. \n\nNotes and citations\n", "context_len": 925, "questions": ["Which British astronomer - a proponent of the steady state theory of the universe - is usually credited with having coined the term ' big bang ' ?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Yahoo!

The name Karlskoga is derived from Charles (Karl) IX, with skog meaning woods.\n\nHistory\n\nThe parish of Karlskoga was established in 1586 and a wooden church was soon built. In the 17th century fourteen small iron works and eight waterdriven hammers for bar iron were established. Most of these were still operating in the 1860s, but the dominating iron works was the one in nearby Bofors. In 1871, Bofors produced 6,124 metric tons of iron, more than any other plant in Sweden. In 1882, Karlskoga parish (socken) had 11,184 inhabitants.\n\nThe town of Karlskoga has evolved around Bofors, which in late 19th century transformed from iron works to a manufacturer of cannon and in the 20th century a more diversified defense industry. The most famous owner of Bofors was Alfred Nobel who owned the company from 1894 until his death in December 1896. He had the key role in reshaping the iron manufacturer to a modern cannon manufacturer and chemical industry. During the summers of 1894\u20131896 he also lived in the manor house . Even though he died in his villa in Sanremo, Italy and had a home in Paris, France it was decided that his residence was at Bj\u00f6rkborn in Karlskoga. Because of that it was here his famous testament that was written in Paris 1895 was legally registered, which eventually made it possible to establish the Nobel Prize.\n\nIn 1940 the town of Karlskoga and the surrounding area (the same territory as today's Karlskoga Municipality) got the formal title of a city (stad). Since 1971 this term has no legal meaning and only the built-up area is considered a de facto town.\n\nInternational relations\n\nTwin towns \u2013 Sister cities\n\nKarlskoga is twinned with:\n* Aalborg, Denmark \n* H\u00fasav\u00edk, Iceland\n* Riihim\u00e4ki, Finland\n* Sanremo, Italy\n* Wheaton, Illinois, United States\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Aerial photograph of Swedish landscape taken by rocket, 1897 losslesscrop.jpg|Aerial photograph of Karlskoga taken by Alfred Nobel's rocket in 1896 or 1897\nFile:Bj\u00f6rkborn exterior.jpg|The  manor house, Alfred Nobel's residence on the property of the Bofors iron works.\nFile:Karlskoga-church-2008.jpg|The church at Karlskoga.\n\nSports\n\nThe following sports clubs are located in Karlskoga:\n\n* KB Karlskoga FF\n* BIK Karlskoga\n*[http://www.kgagk.se Karlskoga GK]\n", "context_len": 462, "questions": ["What is the name of the Swedish arms manufacturing company formed in 1646 and located in Karlskoga?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Tomato", "Solanum lycopersicum", "Tomat", "Lycopersicum esculentum", "Common tomato", "Tomato varieties", "Hot House tomato", "Tomatoes", "Poma amoris", "Tomatos", "Lycopersicum lycopersicum", "Tomatoe", "Gogonele", "Tomahto", "Lycopersicon lycopersicum", "Tomatto", "Domates", "Green tomatoes", "\ud83c\udf45", "Tomattoe", "Green tomato", "Tamatar", "Potato potato", "Lycopersicon esculentum", "Jitomate", "Tamator", "Hot House tomatoes", "Tomattoes", "Love-apple", "Tamato", "Tomato plant", "Love Apple", "Lycopersicum", "Tomattos"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

Nevertheless, anyone who\u2019s seen the \u201cDo you know how to whistle?\u201d scene in that picture knows who had whose number at the time. Bogart dropped his then wife, Mayo Methot, like the proverbial ton of bricks; he married Bacall a mere 10 days after his divorce from the former was finalized, in 1945. The Bogie-Bacall chemistry remains a marvel to behold, particularly in To Have and Have Not\u2019s follow-up, The Big Sleep. The couple\u2019s union sustained until Bogie\u2019s death in 1957.\nPhoto: From John Kobal Foundation/Getty Images.\nAndrew Garfield and Emma Stone\nThough The Amazing Spider-Man 2 didn\u2019t have quite the same sticking power as the original Stone/Garfield pairing, most of the glowing praise for the movie stemmed from the real-life sparks between fluffy-haired Peter Parker portrayer Andrew Garfield (at 30, a little advanced for even misunderstood post-teen roles, boyish as he may have been) and husky-voiced smart babe Emma Stone, who played iconic Parker lady love Gwen Stacy. After Peter literally let Gwen slip through his fingers to her tragic death, the prospect of continuing the franchise without Stone looked bleak\u2014and ( due to a number of factors ) Garfield hung up his web shooters for good. With their cute paparazzi-dodging ways, Stone and Garfield still seemed like a couple built to last. But in the fall of 2015, the pair split up \u2014only to spark rumors of a reconciliation in the summer of 2016 just by being spotted out on the street together. I guess this is an on-screen relationship fans are unwilling to let go.

While Joanne Woodward was no slouch in the looks department either, she was known more as a virtuoso actor (she had recently turned heads with a multiple-personality portrayal in The Three Faces of Eve). They clicked big time in this Faulkner pastiche, and Newman left his wife of nine years (with whom he\u2019d had three kids) and married Woodward, in 1958.

It is bounded by the Kunlun Mountains to the south, the Pamir Mountains and Tian Shan (ancient Mount Imeon) to the west and north, and the Gobi Desert to the east.\n\nThe name may be an Areeb Uyghur borrowing of the Arabic tark, \"to leave alone/out/behind, relinquish, abandon\" + makan, \"place\".   Another plausible explanation suggests  it is derived from Turki taqlar makan, describing \"the place of ruins\".  \n\nGeography\n\nThe Taklamakan Desert has an area of 337000 km2,  making it slightly smaller than Germany, and includes the Tarim Basin, which is 1000 km long and 400 km wide. It is crossed at its northern and at its southern edge by two branches of the Silk Road as travellers sought to avoid the arid wasteland. \nIt is the world's second largest shifting sand desert with about 85% made up of shifting sand dunes  ranking 16th in size in a ranking of the world's largest deserts. \n\nSome geographers and ecologists prefer to regard the Taklamakan Desert as separate and independent from the Gobi Desert region to its east. \n\nThe People's Republic of China has constructed a cross-desert highway that links the cities of Hotan (on the southern edge) and Luntai (on the northern edge).  In recent years, the desert has expanded in some areas, its sands enveloping farms and villages as a result of desertification.\n\nClimate\n\nBecause it lies in the rain shadow of the Himalayas,Taklamakan is a paradigmatic cold desert climate. Given its relative proximity with the cold to frigid air masses in Siberia, extreme lows are recorded in wintertime, sometimes well below . During the 2008 Chinese winter storms episode, the Taklamakan was reported to be covered for the first time in its entirety with a thin layer of snow reaching 4 cm, with a temperature of  in some observatories.\n\nIts extreme inland position, virtually in the very heartland of Asia and thousands of kilometres from any open body of water, accounts for the cold character of its nights even during summertime.\n\nOasis\n\nThe Taklamakan Desert has very little water; therefore it is hazardous to cross. Merchant caravans on the Silk Road would stop for relief at the thriving oasis towns.  It was in close proximity to many of the ancient civilisations \u2014 to the Northwest is the Amu Darya basin, to the southwest the Afghanistan mountain passes lead to Iran and India, to the east is China, and even to the north ancient towns such as Almaty can be found.\n\nThe key oasis towns, watered by rainfall from the mountains, were Kashgar, Marin, Niya, Yarkand, and Khotan (Hetian) to the south, Kuqa and Turpan in the north, and Loulan and Dunhuang in the east. Now, many, such as Marin and Gaochang, are ruined cities in sparsely inhabited areas in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region of the People's Republic of China. \n\nThe archaeological treasures found in its sand-buried ruins point to Tocharian, early Hellenistic, Indian, and Buddhist influences. Its treasures and dangers have been vividly described by Aurel Stein, Sven Hedin, Albert von Le Coq, and Paul Pelliot. \nMummies, some 4000 years old, have been found in the region. \n\nLater, the Taklamakan was inhabited by Turkic peoples.

{"context": "\nLa donna \u00e8 mobile\n\"\" (The woman is fickle) is the Duke of Mantua's canzone from the beginning of act 3 of Giuseppe Verdi's opera Rigoletto (1851). The canzone is famous as a showcase for tenors. Raffaele Mirate's performance of the bravura aria at the opera's 1851 premiere was hailed as the highlight of the evening. Before the opera's first public performance (in Venice), the song was rehearsed under tight secrecy:  a necessary precaution, as \"\" proved to be incredibly catchy, and soon after the song's first public performance, every gondolier in Venice was singing it.\n\nAs the opera progresses, the reprise of the tune in the following scenes exemplifies a sense of confusion, as Rigoletto realizes that from the sound of the Duke's lively voice coming from within the tavern (offstage), the body in the sack over which he had grimly triumphed, was not that of the Duke after all: Rigoletto had paid Sparafucile, an assassin, to kill the Duke, but Sparafucile had deceived Rigoletto by indiscriminately killing Gilda, Rigoletto's beloved daughter, instead. The song is an irony, as no character in the opera presents traits associated with rationality; every character may be considered callous and ' (\"inconstant\").\n\nThe music\n\nThe almost comical-sounding theme of \"\" is introduced immediately, and runs as illustrated (transposed from the original key of B major). The theme is repeated several times in the approximately two to three minutes it takes to perform the aria, but with the important\u2014and obvious\u2014omission of the last bar. This has the effect of driving the music forward as it creates the impression of being incomplete and unresolved, which it is, ending not on the tonic or dominant but on the submediant. Once the Duke has finished singing, however, the theme is once again repeated; but this time it includes the last, and conclusive, bar and finally resolving to the tonic. The song is strophic in form with an orchestral ritornello.\n\nLibretto\n", "context_len": 385, "questions": ["'La donna e mobile' is from which Verdi opera?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Almond tree", "Luz (nut)", "Amygdalus amara", "Almond oil", "Marcona almonds", "Mandel (nut)", "Badam", "Almond Bitter Oil", "Prunus dulcis", "Almond trees", "Amygdalus communis", "Almendrado", "Amygdalus dulcis", "Marcona Almonds", "Prunus amygdalus dulcis", "Druparia amygdalus", "Marcona almond", "Marcona Almond", "Prunus amygdalus", "Almond extract", "Amygdalus fragilis", "Amygdalus sativa", "Baadaam", "Oil of bitter almond", "Toasted Almond", "Oleum amygdalae", "Bitter almonds", "Sweet almond oil", "Almond", "\u0644\u0648\u0632", "Almonds", "Oil of Bitter Almonds", "Almond syrup", "Bitter almond"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nHippocrates Biography: Let Thy Food be Thy Medicine\nHippocrates Biography: Let Thy Food be Thy Medicine\nHippocrates Bio\nWritten by Tel Asiado.\nThroughout his life Hippocrates traveled widely throughout Greece and Asia Minor teaching or practicing  medicine. He presumably taught at the medical school at Cos quite frequently. Undoubtedly, Hippocrates was  an historical figure, and a great physician who exercised a permanent influence on the development of  medicine and on the ideals and ethics of a physician.\nQuotation\n\"Let thy food be thy medicine and thy medicine be thy food.\" - Hippocrates\n\"It is necessary for a physician to know about nature, and be very eager to know, if he is going  to perform any of his duties... what man is in relation to what he eats and drinks, and in relation to  his habits generally, and what will be the effect of each upon each individual.\" - Hippocrates, On where the two worlds meet: a holistic approach to medicine.\nEarly Life\nLittle is known about the early life of Hippocrates. Historians tend to agree that he was born  around the year 460 BC, on the Greek island of Cos (or Kos). Soranus of Ephesus, a second-century  Greek gynecologist, and considered to be Hippocrates\u2019 first biographer, wrote about his life but the  contents of this biography and later lives were either traditional or imaginative.\nFrom the biographical accounting of Soranus:  Hippocrates' father was Heraclides, a physician, and  his mother was Praxitela, daughter of Tizane. He learned medicine from his father and grandfather, and  studied other subjects with Democritus and Gorgias. He was probably trained at the asklepieion of Kos,  and also studied from the Thracian physician Herodicus of Selymbria.\nOther information can be found in the writings of Aristotle which date from the 4th century BC. Plato  also mentions Hippocrates in two of his dialogues: Potagonas, where Plato describes Hippocrates as \"Hippocrates of Kos, the Asclepiad,\" and Phaedrus, where Plato suggests that \"Hippocrates the Asclepiad\" thought that a complete knowledge of the nature of the body was necessary for medicine.\nMajor accomplishments\nConsidered to be the \"Father of Medicine\" and famous for \"Hippocratic Oath,\" Hippocrates revolutionized  the practice of medicine by shifting western medicine from the religious to the \u201crational.\u201d He believes  doctors should analyze symptoms on a case-by-case basis, instead of having blanket causes and/or cures  for each disease. He developed the practice of clinical observation in four stages: diagnosis, prognosis,  observation and treatment. He taught and practiced medicine. Hippocrates was so revered that his teachings  were greatly taken, with no significant advancements of his methods for a long time. He and his followers  were first to describe many diseases and medical conditions.\nHippocrates began the scientific study of medicine, and numerous medical writings have survived that  bear his name, although most of which suspected not written by him. It is difficult to separate  the facts or myths from later tales to assess his accomplishments in medicine. As time went on,  reverence for the past had to contend with new developments of scientific method and discoveries.  General knowledge of his medical writings might have faded, but Hippocrates continues to represent  the humane and ethical aspects of the medical profession.\nHe categorized illnesses as acute, chronic, endemic and epidemic, and use terms such as, \"exacerbation,  relapse, resolution, crisis, paroxysm, peak, and convalescence.\"\nHe described symptomatology, physical findings, surgical treatment and prognosis of thoracic  empyema, relating to the chest cavity lining.\nHis teachings remain relevant to present-day students of pulmonary medicine and surgery.\nHe first documented chest surgeon and his findings and techniques, while crude, such as the use of  lead pipes to drain chest wall abscess, are still valid.\nThe Hippocratic School of Medicine described well the ailments of the human rectum and its treatment,  despite the school's poor theory of medicine at the time.\nHemorrhoids, though believed to be caused by an excess of bile and phlegm, were treated by Hippocratic  physicians in a relatively advanced ways. Cautery and excision are described in the Hippocratic Corpus,  in addition to the preferred methods of ligating the hemorrhoids and drying them with a hot iron.\nSome fundamental concepts of proctoscopy outlined in the Corpus are still in use. For example, the  uses of the rectal speculum, a common medical device, are discussed. This constitutes the earliest  recorded reference to endoscopy.\nThe Hippocratic Corpus, a collection of around seventy early medical works (containing textbooks,  lectures, notes and philosophical essays on various subjects in medicine), is written in Ionic Greek  that bears Hippocrates' name. The question whether Hippocrates was the author of the corpus has not  been conclusively answered, but the volumes were probably produced by his students and followers due to  the variety of subjects, writing styles and apparent date of construction. Notable among the treatises  of the Corpus are The Hippocratic Oath (the most famous); The Book of Prognostics; On Regimen in Acute  Diseases; Aphorisms; On Airs, Waters and Places; Instruments of Reduction; and On The Sacred Disease.\nTimeline\n(Little is known about his actual timeline except his birth and death, which are also approximate dates.)\n460 BC - Hippocrates was born on the island of Cos, Greece.\n370 BC - Hippocrates died in Larissa, Thessaly.\nDeath\nHippocrates' actual date of death is not known. It is believed that he passed away anywhere between  83 and 90 years of age in Larissa, Thessaly. Some say he lived to be well over 100.\nAbout the Author\nTel Asiado is a writer, author, content producer, and business consultant. She owns various niche  websites.

{"context": "\nGaius Octavius (proconsul)\nGaius Octavius  (about 100 \u2013 59 BC) was an ancestor to the Roman Emperors of the Julio-Claudian dynasty. He is the father of the Emperor Augustus, step-grandfather of the Emperor Tiberius, great-grandfather of the Emperor Claudius, great-great grandfather of the Emperor Caligula, and great-great-great grandfather of the Emperor Nero. Hailing from Velitrae, he descended from an old, wealthy equestrian branch of the gens Octavia. Despite being from a wealthy family, his family was plebeian, rather than patrician. As a novus homo (\"new man\"), he would not be of a senatorial family.\n\nHis grandfather, Gaius Octavius, fought as a military tribune in Sicily during the Second Punic War. His father Gaius Octavius was a municipal magistrate who lived to an advanced age. He is a distant relative (possibly as third cousins, through their ancestor Gnaeus Octavius Rufus) to Gnaeus Octavius, the consul of 87 BC who led the opposition to Lucius Cornelius Cinna.\n\nPersonal life\n\nOctavius' first wife was named Ancharia. The two had a child (named Octavia Major). It is not known how the marriage ended, although it is possible that Ancharia died during child birth. He later married the niece of Julius Caesar, Atia Balba Caesonia. How they met is not known, although Atia's family on her father's side (the Balbi) lived close to Velitrae, which was the ancestral home of the Octavii. They had two children: Octavia Minor and the Emperor Augustus, the latter of whom was born in 63 BC.\n\nPolitical career\n\nOctavius was elected quaestor, believed to have been in 70 BC. In 61 BC, he was elected praetor. In 60 BC, after his term had ended, he was appointed propraetor, and was to serve as governor (praefectus pro praetor) of Macedonia. Before he left for Macedonia, the senate sent him to put down a slave rebellion at Thurii. These slaves had previously taken part in the rebellions of Spartacus and Catiline. He then left for Macedonia and proved a capable administrator, governing \"courageously and justly\", his deeds included leading the Roman forces to victory in an unexpected battle against the Thracian Bessian tribe. Cicero had high regard for his diplomatic dealings. Because of his successful term as governor of Macedonia, he won the support necessary to be elected consul.\n\nIn 59 BC, Octavius sailed to Rome, to stand for election as consul. However, he died in Nola, before arriving in Rome. He supposedly died in the same bedroom where his son Augustus would pass away many years later.  His career is summarized in an inscription erected by his son on the forum he built in Rome: \n\nC(aius) Octavius C(ai) f(ilius) C(ai) n(epos) C(ai) pr[on(epos)]\npater Augusti\ntr(ibunus) mil(itum) bis q(uaestor) aed(ilis) pl(ebis) cum\nC(aio) Toranio iudex quaestionum\npr(aetor) proco(n)s(ul) imperator appellatus\nex provincia Macedonia\n\n\u201cGaius Octavius, son, grandson and great-grandson of Gaius,\nfather of Augustus,\ntwice military tribune, quaestor, aedile of the plebs together with\nGaius Toranius, judge,\npraetor, proconsul, proclaimed imperator\nin the province of Macedonia\u201d\n\nFamily tree of the Octavii Rufi\n\nSince the last Gaius Octavius (Augustus) was adopted by his great-uncle Julius Caesar and become one of the Julii Caesares, the family's original nomen gentile was not descended to his only daughter (i.e. Julia the Elder) and adopted sons (i.e. Gaius Caesar, Lucius Caesar, Tiberius, Agrippa Postumus), which end the Octavii Rufi's male line.\n", "context_len": 714, "questions": ["What is Gaius Octavius better known as?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Game On", "Game On (TV series)", "Game On!", "Game On (disambiguation)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

Opie, The Oxford Dictionary of Nursery Rhymes (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1951, 2nd edn., 1997), p. 306. It has a Roud Folk Song Index number of 3753.\n\nLyrics\n\nThe modern words are:\n\nThree blind mice. Three blind mice.\nSee how they run. See how they run.\nThey all ran after the farmer's wife,\nWho cut off their tails with a carving knife,\nDid you ever see such a sight in your life,\nAs three blind mice?W. S. Baring-Gould and C. Baring-Gould, The Annotated Mother Goose: Nursery Rhymes Old and New (Bramhall House, 1962), p. 156.\n\n\"Complete version\"\n\nPublished by Frederick Warne & Co., an illustrated children's book by John W. Ivimey entitled The Complete Version of Ye Three Blind Mice,  fleshes the mice out into mischievous characters who seek adventure, eventually being taken in by a farmer whose wife chases them from the house and into a bramble bush, which blinds them. Soon after, their tails are removed by \"the butcher's wife\" when the complete version incorporates the original verse. The story ends with them using a tonic to grow new tails and recover their eyesight, learning a trade (making wood chips, according to the accompanying illustration), buying a house and living happily ever after. Published perhaps in 1900,  the book is now in the public domain. \n\nOrigins and meaning\n\nA version of this rhyme, together with music, was published in Deuteromelia or The Seconde part of Musicks melodie (1609). The editor of the book, and possible author of the rhyme,  was Thomas Ravenscroft, who in 1609 was still a teenager. The original lyrics are:\n\nThree Blinde Mice,\nThree Blinde Mice,\nDame Iulian,\nDame Iulian,\nthe Miller and his merry olde Wife,\nshe scrapte her tripe licke thou the knife.\n\nAttempts to read historical significance into the words have led to the speculation that this musical round was written earlier and refers to Queen Mary I of England blinding and executing three Protestant bishops,  but problematically the Oxford Martyrs, Ridley, Latimer and Cranmer, were burned at the stake, not blinded; although if the rhyme was made by crypto-Catholics, the mice's \"blindness\" could refer to their Protestantism.\n\nThe rhyme only entered children's literature in 1842 when it was published in a collection by James Orchard Halliwell.\n\nVariations\n\nAmateur music composer Thomas Oliphant (1799\u20131873)  noted in 1843 that:\nThis absurd old round is frequently brought to mind in the present day, from the circumstance of there being an instrumental Quartet by Weiss, through which runs a musical phrase accidentally the same as the notes applied to the word Three Blind Mice. They form a third descending, C, B, A. \n\nRobert Schumann's Kreisleriana #7, which is arguably about a cat (Murr), appears to be based upon \"Three Blind Mice\", but in a predominantly minor key. \"Three Blind Mice\" is to be found in the fugue which is the centerpiece of #7.\n\nJoseph Holbrooke (1878\u20131958) composed his Symphonic Variations, opus 37, based on Three Blind Mice. Also, Joseph Haydn used its theme in the Finale (4th Mvt) of his Symphony 83 (La Poule) (1785\u201386); one of the 6 Paris Symphonies, and the music also appears in the final movement of English composer Eric Coates' suite The Three Men. \"Three Blind Mice\" was also used as a theme song for The Three Stooges and a Curtis Fuller arrangement of the rhyme is featured on the Art Blakey live album of the same name. The song is also the basis for Leroy Anderson's orchestral \"Fiddle Faddle\".\n\nThe theme of the second movement of Sergei Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 4 (1926, revised 1928 and 1941) was criticized as resembling Three Blind Mice.\n\nColorado rock band Sawatch recorded a version of Three Blind Mice on their new cd \"Another Gin.'\n\nUse in popular culture\n\nThe soundtrack for the 1962 James Bond film Dr. No features  \"Kingston Calypso\", a calypso version of \"Three Blind Mice\" with new lyrics, in reference to three villainous characters in the film. \n\nIn several sports (basketball and hockey, for example, which have three referees), \"Three Blind Mice\" is used as a derogatory phrase for poor referees. Bands also play the song to mock referees in similar cases. Such references, however, are frowned upon officially by both sports as unsportsmanlike.

Before Major League Baseball required four umpires at every game, there were regularly three. The Brooklyn Dodgers had a fan band called the \"Sym-Phoney Band\", led by Shorty Laurice, which started playing \"Three Blind Mice\" when the umpires came out onto the field until the league office ordered the team to stop, around the same time a fourth umpire was added. In 1985, Wilbur Snapp, the organist for the Clearwater Phillies, was thrown out of the game for playing \"Three Blind Mice\" after what he considered a bad call. In 1992, Jason Patrick, keyboardist for the Amarillo Texans independent baseball team, was also ejected for playing the song after a disputed call.  On August 1, 2012, during a Daytona Cubs \u2013 Fort Myers Miracle minor-league baseball game, umpire Mario Seneca tossed the public address announcer Derek Dye for playing the song \"Three Blind Mice\" after a disputed call at first base. \n\nCanadian rock trio Rush often played \"Three Blind Mice\" as an intro to their own songs in concert, notably during their \"Hold Your Fire\" tour of 1987\u20131988.

In 2000 the supercharged XKR was added to the range.  The XKR featured 370 supercharged horsepower, a subtle rear spoiler, wire mesh front grille, and red exterior emblems.  The early XKR's motor was made in England, the ignition system was from NGK in Japan, the transmission was a Mercedes-Benz 722.6, the lighting system was by Valeo in France, and the supercharger was made by Eaton in the USA.  So it was truly a world car.  The 2000-2002 XKR's had the 4.0 engine which featured a plastic timing chain tensioner.  The 2000 XKR received positive reviews from magazines including Road & Track, Car & Driver, and Automobile.\n\nThe XK8 came standard with 17-inch alloy wheels, while 18-inch (Standard on the XKR), 19-inch, and 20-inch wheels were available for the XK8 at an additional cost. Jaguar's Adaptive Cruise Control is an optional feature available on both models. Both models came with all-leather interior, burl walnut trim, and side airbags.   \n\nXK/XKR (2006\u20132014)\n\nThe redesigned XK debuted in 2005 at the Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany, styled by Jaguar's chief designer Ian Callum.  The X150's grille was also inspired from the famous 1961 Jaguar E-Type. \n\nThe standard XK model has an unlimited top speed of 158\u00a0mph whilst the XKR an unlimited top speed of 174\u00a0mph. An even faster variant, the XKR-S model was introduced at the Geneva Motor Show in 2012. The XKR-S gained an additional 40-horsepower over the XKR bringing the 0-60\u00a0mph time down to only 4.4 seconds and the top speed up to 300\u00a0km/h (186 mph) - making it the fastest Jaguar yet after the Jaguar XJ220. A convertible version of the XKR-S was released in 2012. \n\nProduction of the XK ended in July 2014 without a replacement model until the subsequent F-Type.\n", "context_len": 506, "questions": ["Which British manufacturer introduced the 'XK 120' sports car in 1948?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Marcel Marco", "Mime Marceau", "Le Troisi\u00e8me Oeil", "Marcel marseau", "Bip the clown", "Marcel Mangel", "Le Troisieme Oeil", "Marcel Marceau"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nHow They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix\n\"How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix\" is a poem by Robert Browning published in Dramatic Romances and Lyrics, 1845.  The poem, one of the volume's \"dramatic romances\", is a first-person narrative told, in breathless galloping meter, by one of three riders; the midnight errand is urgent\u2014\"the news which alone could save Aix from her fate\"\u2014but what that good news actually is, is never revealed; the poem is \"noted for its onomatopoetic effects. It describes a purely imaginary incident\", observed William Rose Benet.  Browning himself remarked in a letter, \"There is no historical incident whatever commemorated in the poem. . . . a merely general impression of the characteristic warfare and besieging which abound in the annals of Flanders\".  Undaunted, an editor of Browning suggested the historical event of the Pacification of Ghent. \n\nBrowning wrote it while at sea, sailing from London to Trieste. The sequence of towns between Ghent and Aix-la-Chapelle is a rational one. The work itself describes an imaginary historical incident before the age of telegraph,  metaled turnpike, and railroad.\n \nThe towns through which the riders pass are characterized only by the associated time of night, dawn, and day, also a feature of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's later poem of urgent nightlong news bearing, \"Paul Revere's Ride\".\n \nThe poem was parodied by W. C. Sellar and R. J. Yeatman in their book Horse Nonsense as \"How I Brought the Good News from Aix to Ghent (or Vice Versa)\". \n\nIn 1889, Browning attempted to recite the poem into a  phonograph at a public gathering, but forgot the words; this is the only record of Browning's voice.\n", "context_len": 335, "questions": ["Who wrote the poem How They Brought The Good News From Ghent To Aix?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Vivaldi", "A.Vivaldi", "Antonio Lucio Vivaldi", "The Red Priest", "A.

{"context": "\nAnpan\nis a Japanese sweet roll most commonly filled with red bean paste. However, it is often confused that the main ingredient for Anpan (also known as bread) is red bean paste. Anpan can also be prepared with other fillings, including white beans (shiro-an), green beans (uguisu-an), sesame (goma-an) and chestnut (kuri-an).\n\nHistory\n\nAnpan was first made in 1875, during the Meiji period, by a man called Yasubei Kimura, a samurai who lost his job with the rise of the conscript Imperial Army and the dissolution of the samurai as a social class. The Meiji era was a period in which Japan was becoming increasingly westernized, and many samurai who lost their jobs were given work that was totally new to them. The Western role of baker was one such job.\n\nOne day, while wandering around the area where many people employed in Western jobs worked, Kimura Yasubei found a young man making breads and an idea was born; the starting of the bakery named Bun'eid\u014d (\u6587\u82f1\u5802). In 1874, He moved to Ginza and renamed the bakery Kimuraya (\u6728\u6751\u5c4b). At that time, however, the only recipe for bread known in Japan was for making a salty and sour-tasting bread, ill-suited to Japanese tastes at the time. Yasubei wanted to make a bread that was more to Japanese tastes. Finally, he figured out how to make bread in the way of the Japanese manju \u2013 raising the dough with the traditional sakadane liquid yeast. He then filled the bread with a bean paste wagashi and sold anpan as snacks. Anpan was very popular, not only because of its taste, but also because the Japanese were interested in anything new and foreign at this time.\n\nLater, a man called Yamaoka Tessh\u016b, a chamberlain of the Meiji emperor, who loved anpan, asked the Tokugawas, the rulers of Japan before the Meiji Period, to present anpans to the emperor when visiting him. So the Tokugawas asked Yasubei to make some for the emperor. Yasubei worked hard to make the anpan and, because he also cared about their appearance, he decorated them with a salt-pickled sakura in the middle of each bun. This anpan was presented to the Meiji emperor on April 4, 1875. The Emperor told Yasubei to present him anpan every day, and because of the rumor that the Emperor ate anpan, the popularity of bread, and especially anpan, began spreading around the country.\n\nInfluence on Japanese popular culture\n\nAnpan is often used as slang for recreational inhalation of paint thinner. \n\nThe anime Anpanman is about a superhero whose head is made of anpan.\n\nIn the anime franchise Clannad the main character Nagisa Furukawa often mentions \"Anpan\" to herself.\n\nIn anime Gintama, character Sagaru Yamazaki is seen eating anpan as a ritual that references famous Japanese TV detective dramas while going undercover and eventually goes insane because of it (episode 205). \n\nIn the tokusatsu series Denshi Sentai Denjiman, the character Daigorou Oume/Denji Bue loves anpan. Long after the series ending, he appears in the movie Gokaiger vs. Goseiger and sells anpan.\n\nThe San-X character, Kogepan, is a burnt anpan who is depressed and gets drunk from milk. \n\nThe Log Horizon character Akatsuki loves anpan, but feels that it's best when accompanied by green tea.\n", "context_len": 623, "questions": ["Anpan is a sweet roll, usually filled with red bean paste, which originates from which country?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Cambridge, United Kingdom", "Cambridge, UK", "Cantabrigiae", "The weather in Cambridge", "Christ's Piece", "Caergrawnt", "Cambridge, East Anglia", "England Cambridge", "UN/LOCODE:GBCMG", "Cambridge, Cambridgeshire", "Cambridge (England)", "Cambridge", "Park Street Church of England Primary School", "Cambridge, England", "Grantabridge"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nKen Platt\nKen Platt (born Kenneth Platt, 17 February 1921, Leigh, Lancashire \u2013 2 October 1998, Blackpool, Lancashire) was a British northern comedian. \n\nEarly life\n\nPlatt decided to become a comedian at the age of 15. He bought a ukulele and performed at local concert parties where he was billed as \"George Formby the second\", in homage to his idol. He joined the Army in 1942 and was posted to North Africa where he appeared in a concert party, \"The Forest Mummers\". His flair for comedy performances eventually won him a transfer to CSE, the Combined Services Entertainment unit. The rest of his war service was spent touring North Africa, Corsica, Scandinavia, Italy and Greece. After demobilisation he could be found entertaining the armed forces in Austria and Germany. Demobbed five years later he tried his hand at show business with little success. Disillusioned, he bought a grocery store in his hometown.\n\nRadio and TV\n\nWorking in a grocer's shop in Leigh, his home town, he was spotted by Ronnie Taylor (scriptwriter), a BBC scriptwriter and producer who asked him to audition in July 1950. As a result, from early the next year, Platt became the resident comedian on the BBC's popular radio show Variety Fanfare, which made him a household name.  It was on radio that Platt was in his true element with his immaculate timing and brilliant ad-libbing. With a flat cap and droll line, he was best remembered by the catchphrase with which he began every performance: \"Allo, I won't take me coat off - I'm not stoppin'!\" Platt was one of the last links with music hall and variety in Great Britain.\n\nHe was a guest comedian on numerous radio variety shows and later topped the bill in pantomimes and summer seasons throughout Great Britain. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s he was a regular guest star on television programmes such as Big Night Out, Spot the Tune and The Liver Birds. He evoked considerable nostalgia by a memorable appearance on BBC's The Good Old Days using much of his material from his days on \"steam radio\".\n\nA stroke in 1990 affected his speech and forced his retirement. Brian Robinson, his partner and (by then, former) manager, survived him.\n", "context_len": 436, "questions": ["\"Which comedian's catchphrase was \"\"I won't take me coat off, I'm not stopping\"\"?\""], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Fruiting", "Friut", "Fruiting Shrubs", "Prutas", "Bacca", "Nutritious fruits", "Simple fruit", "Culture of fruits", "Fruits", "Fleshy fruit", "Seed pod", "Pod types", "Fruit", "Fruity"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nCarrick bend\nThe carrick bend is a knot used for joining two lines. It is particularly appropriate for very heavy rope or cable that is too large and stiff to easily be formed into other common bends.    It will not jam even after carrying a significant load or being soaked with water.   As with many other members of the basket weave knot family, the carrick bend's aesthetically pleasing interwoven and symmetrical shape has also made it popular for decorative purposes.\n\nThe knot features prominently as a motif in the hard science fiction novel Picoverse by Robert A. Metzger.\n\nHeraldry\n\nIn heraldry, this known as the \"Wake knot\" or \"Ormonde knot\", due to being used as a heraldic badge of various families. \n\nEtymology \n\nThis knot's name dates back to at least 1783, when it was included in a nautical bilingual dictionary authored by Daniel Lescallier.   Its origins prior to that are not known with certainty. There are several possible explanations for the name \"Carrick\" being associated with this bend. The Elizabethan era plasterwork of Ormonde Castle in Carrick-on-Suir shows numerous carrick bends molded in relief. Or the name may come from Carrick Roads\u2014a large natural anchorage by Falmouth in Cornwall, England. The name may also have been derived from the Carrack, a medieval type of ship. \n\nVariations \n\nThe eight crossings within the carrick bend allow for many similar-looking knots to be made. The lines in a \"full\" or \"true\" carrick bend alternate between over and under at every crossing. There are also two ways the ends can emerge from the knot: diagonally opposed or from the same side. The latter form is also called the double coin knot. The form with the ends emerging diagonally opposed is considered more secure.\n\nUnfortunately, with so many permutations, the carrick bend is prone to being tied incorrectly.\n\nAppearance\n\nCapsized\n\nThe carrick bend is generally tied in a flat interwoven form as shown above. Without additional measures it will collapse into a different shape when tightened, a process known as capsizing, with the degree of capsizing depending on the looseness of the weave. This capsized form is both secure and stable once tightened, although it is bulkier than the seized form below. Incomplete capsizing resulting from a tight weave produces a form that is likewise secure and stable, but which is more difficult to untie, countering one of the advantages of the carrick bend. When the knot is allowed to capsize naturally under tension, considerable slippage of line through the knot can occur before tightening, so the knot should be set carefully before loading to avoid this slippage in use. \n\nSeized\n\nIn the interest of making the carrick bend easier to untie, especially when tied in extremely large rope, the ends may be seized to prevent the knot from collapsing when load is applied. This practice also keeps the knot's profile flatter and can ease its passage over capstans or winches. \n\nThe ends are traditionally seized to their standing part using a round seizing. For expediency, a series of double constrictor knots, drawn very tight, may also be used.  When seizing the carrick bend, both ends must be secured to their standing parts or the bend will slip.\n\nDecorative uses\n\nIn the decorative variation, both standing ends enter from one side and both working ends exit from the other. In this configuration the knot is known as the Josephine knot (macrame) or double coin knot (Chinese knotting). This form of the carrick bend is found depicted in heraldry, sometimes with the tails of heraldic serpents woven (or \"nowed\") into this knot.   In heraldry the knot is associated with Hereward the Wake and is known under the name Wake knot. It is depicted in the coat of arms of Bourne Town Council, Lincolnshire. \n\nThe knot can be tied using doubled lines for an even flatter, more elaborate appearance. A doubled carrick bend was used to ornamentally secure the lanyards on the breastplate of the US Navy Mark V diving helmet during inspection and between dives.\n\nWhen the ends of the carrick bend are connected together, or more practically hidden behind the knot, it becomes a carrick mat. This same configuration is also one of the most basic Turk's head knots.\n\nSecurity\n\nThe fully interwoven diagonal carrick bend is the most secure variation. All other forms are inferior and not recommended as bends.\n\nAlthough the carrick bend has a reputation for strength, some tests have shown it to be as weak as 65% efficiency.\n", "context_len": 839, "questions": ["Of what is a carrick bend a type?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["John le Carre", "John Le Carr", "John leCarr\u00e9", "John Le Carre", "John leCarre", "John lecarre", "Le Carre", "Le carre", "Le Carr\u00e9", "John LeCarr\u00e9", "John Lecarre", "David John Moore Cornwell", "John Le Carr\u00e9", "John le Carr\u00e9", "John LeCarre", "John Lecarr\u00e9"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nOssuary\nAn ossuary is a chest, box, building, well, or site made to serve as the final resting place of human skeletal remains. They are frequently used where burial space is scarce. A body is first buried in a temporary grave, then after some years the skeletal remains are removed and placed in an ossuary. The greatly reduced space taken up by an ossuary means that it is possible to store the remains of many more people in a single tomb than if the original coffins were left as is.\n\nPersian \n\nIn Persia, the Zoroastrians used a deep well for this function from the earliest times (c. 3,000 years ago) and called it astudan (literally, \"the place for the bones\"). There are many rituals and regulations in the Zoroastrian faith concerning the astudans.\n\nRoman Catholic \n\nMany examples of ossuaries are found within Europe, including the Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini in Rome, Italy; in south Italy the Martyrs of Otranto; the Fontanelle cemetery and Purgatorio ad Arco, Naples and many others; the San Bernardino alle Ossa in Milan, Italy; the Sedlec Ossuary in the Czech Republic; the Skull Chapel in Czermna in Lower Silesia, Poland; and Capela dos Ossos (\"Chapel of Bones\") in \u00c9vora, Portugal. The village of Wamba in the province of Valladolid, Spain, has an impressive ossuary of over a thousand skulls inside the local church, dating from between the 12th and 18th centuries. A more recent example is the Douaumont ossuary in France, which contains the remains of more than 130,000 French and German soldiers that fell at the Battle of Verdun during World War I. The Catacombs of Paris represents another famous ossuary.\n\nThe catacombs beneath the Monastery of San Francisco in Lima, Peru, also contains an ossuary.\n\nEastern Orthodox\n\nThe use of ossuaries is a longstanding tradition in the Orthodox Church. The remains of an Orthodox Christian are treated with special reverence, in conformity with the biblical teaching that the body of a believer is a \"temple of the Holy Spirit\" (, etc.), having been sanctified and transfigured by Baptism, Holy Communion and the participation in the mystical life of the Church.  In Orthodox monasteries, when one of the brethren dies, his remains are buried (for details, see Christian burial) for one to three years, and then disinterred, cleaned and gathered into the monastery's charnel house. If there is reason to believe that the departed is a saint, the remains may be placed in a reliquary; otherwise the bones are usually mingled together (skulls together in one place, long bones in another, etc.). The remains of an abbot may be placed in a separate ossuary made out of wood or metal.\n\nThe use of ossuaries is also found among the laity in the Greek Orthodox Church. The departed will be buried for one to three years and then, often on the anniversary of death, the family will gather with the parish priest and celebrate a parastas (memorial service), after which the remains are disinterred, washed with wine, perfumed, and placed in a small ossuary of wood or metal, inscribed with the name of the departed, and placed in a room, often in or near the church, which is dedicated to this purpose.\n\nJewish\n\nDuring the time of the Second Temple, Jewish burial customs included primary burials in burial caves, followed by secondary burials in ossuaries placed in smaller niches of the burial caves. Some of the limestone ossuaries that have been discovered, particularly around the Jerusalem area, include intricate geometrical patterns and inscriptions identifying the deceased. Among the best-known Jewish ossuaries of this period are: an ossuary inscribed 'Simon the Temple builder' in the collection of the Israel Museum, another inscribed 'Elisheba wife of Tarfon', one inscribed 'Yehohanan ben Hagkol' that contained an iron nail in a heel bone suggesting crucifixion, another inscribed 'James son of Joseph, brother of Jesus', the authenticity of which is opposed by some and strongly supported by others, and ten ossuaries recovered from the Talpiot Tomb in 1980, several of which are reported to have names from the New Testament.\n\nDuring the Second Temple period, Jewish sages debated whether the occasion of the gathering of a parent's bones for a secondary burial was a day of sorrow or rejoicing; it was resolved that it was a day of fasting in the morning and feasting in the afternoon. The custom of secondary burial in ossuaries did not persist among Jews past the Second Temple period nor appear to exist among Jews outside the land of Israel.\n", "context_len": 867, "questions": ["What would you find in an ossuary?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Muhammad (teddy bear)", "Teddy muhammad", "Jillian Gibbons", "Gillian gibbons", "GILLIAN GIBBONS", "Gillian Gibbons", "Teddy bear case", "Sara Khawad", "Sudan teddy bear controversy", "Muhammad teddy", "Teddy bear controversy", "Sudanese teddy bear blasphemy case", "Muhammad teddy bear"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nPangram\nA Pangram (, pan gramma, \"every letter\") or holoalphabetic sentence for a given alphabet is a sentence using every letter of the alphabet at least once. Pangrams have been used to display typefaces, test equipment, and develop skills in handwriting, calligraphy, and keyboarding.\n\nThe best known English pangram is \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" It has been used since at least the late 19th century, was utilized by Western Union to test Telex / TWX data communication equipment for accuracy and reliability,  and is now used by a number of computer programs (most notably the font viewer built into Microsoft Windows) to display computer fonts. An example in another language is ', containing all letters used in German , including every umlaut (\u00e4, \u00f6, \u00fc) plus the \u00df.  It has been used since before 1800.\n\nShort pangrams in English are more difficult to come up with and tend to use uncommon words. A perfect pangram contains every letter of the alphabet only once and can be considered an anagram of the alphabet; it is the shortest possible pangram.  An example is the phrase \"Cwm fjord bank glyphs vext quiz\" (', a loan word from Welsh, means a steep-sided valley, particularly in Wales). However, such examples are not usually understood even by native English speakers, and so arguably are not really English pangrams. \n\nHere are some short pangrams using standard written English, not involving abbreviations or proper nouns:\n# \"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.\" (32 letters)\n# \"Jackdaws love my big sphinx of quartz.\" (31 letters)\n# \"The five boxing wizards jump quickly.\" (31 letters)\n# \"How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!\" (30 letters)\n# \"Bright vixens jump; dozy fowl quack.\" (29 letters)\n\nLonger pangrams may afford more opportunity for humor, cleverness, or thoughtfulness.   \n\nIn a sense, the pangram is the opposite of the lipogram, in which the aim is to omit one or more letters.\n\nLogographic scripts \n\nLogographic scripts, that is, writing systems composed principally of logograms, cannot be used to produce pangrams in the literal sense, since they are radically different from alphabets or other phonetic writing systems. In such scripts, the total number of signs is large and imprecisely defined, so producing a text with every possible sign is impossible. However, various analogies to pangrams are feasible, including traditional pangrams in a romanization. In Japanese, although typical orthography uses kanji (logograms), pangrams are required to contain every kana (syllabic character) when written out in kana alone: the Iroha is a classic example.\n\nIn addition, it is possible to create pangrams that demonstrate certain aspects of logographic characters.\n\nIn Chinese, the Thousand Character Classic is a 1000-character poem in which each character is used exactly once; however, it does not include all Chinese characters. The single character  (permanence) incorporates every basic stroke used to write Chinese characters exactly once, as described in the Eight Principles of Yong.\n\nSelf-enumerating pangrams \n\nA self-enumerating pangram is a pangrammatic autogram, or a sentence that inventories its own letters, each of which occurs at least once. The first example was produced by Rudy Kousbroek, a Dutch journalist and essayist, who publicly challenged Lee Sallows, a British recreational mathematician resident in the Netherlands, to produce an English translation of his Dutch pangram. In the sequel, Sallows built an electronic \"pangram machine\", that performed a  systematic search among millions of candidate solutions. The machine was successful in identifying the following 'magic' translation:   \nThis pangram contains four As, one B, two Cs, one D, thirty Es, six Fs, five Gs, seven Hs, eleven Is, one J, one K, two Ls, two Ms, eighteen Ns, fifteen Os, two Ps, one Q, five Rs, twenty-seven Ss, eighteen Ts, two Us, seven Vs, eight Ws, two Xs, three Ys, & one Z.\n\nChris Patuzzo, a British computer scientist was able to reduce the problem of finding a self-enumerating pangram to the Boolean satisfiability problem. He did this by using a bespoke Hardware description language as a stepping stone and then applied the Tseitin transformation to the resulting chip. \n\nPangrams in literature\n\nThe pangram \"The quick brown fox...\" and searches for a shorter pangram are the cornerstone of the plot of the novel Ella Minnow Pea by Mark Dunn.  The search successfully comes to an end when the phrase \"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs\" is discovered.\n", "context_len": 880, "questions": ["According to the pangram, the quick what jumps over the lazy dog?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Tony (Manero).", "Tony Manero"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nArequipa Region\nArequipa is a region in southwestern Peru. It is bordered by the Ica, Ayacucho, Apur\u00edmac and Cusco regions in the north, the Puno Region in the east, the Moquegua Region in the south and the Pacific Ocean in the west. Its capital, also called Arequipa, is Peru's second-largest city.\n\nGeography\n\nThis region has a rough topography which is characterized by heavy layers of volcanic lava covering large areas of its inter-Andean sector. It has deep canyons such as the ones formed by the Oco\u00f1a and Majes rivers.  Plateaus range in height from medium, such as La Joya, and high-altitude ones such the Arrieros Pampa and those located in the zones of Chivay, Huambo and Pichucolla.  Volcanic cones are seen emerging above the plateaus and forming snowfalls, such as Misti, Chachani, Ampato, Mismi, Sulimana and Coropuna. In contrast with these heights, there are deep canyons, including Majes, Colca, Sihuas and Oco\u00f1a, where important aspects of the ecological evolution of this zone can be clearly observed.\n\nAlong the coast, small plateaus and dunes represent characteristics of the desert of Arequipa, such as the ones located in the Majes, Sihuas and La Joya plains, which are particularly beautiful and developed.\n\nFrom a hydrographic point of view, the rivers draining its territory belong mainly to the Pacific watershed.  Some rivers belong to the Amazon hydrographic system. Some of the region's main rivers are: Oco\u00f1a, Yauca, Caman\u00e1 and Quilca.  The starting point of the Amazon River is located in the Arequipa region .\n\nPolitical division\n\nThe region is divided into eight provinces (provincias, singular: provincia), which are composed of 109 districts (distritos, singular: distrito). The provinces, with their capitals in parentheses, are:\n# Arequipa (Arequipa)\n# Caman\u00e1 (Caman\u00e1)\n# Caravel\u00ed (Caravel\u00ed)\n# Castilla (Aplao)\n# Caylloma (Chivay)\n# Condesuyos (Chuquibamba)\n# Islay (Mollendo)\n# La Uni\u00f3n (Cotahuasi)\n\nPeople \n\nLanguages \n\nAccording to the 2007 Peru Census, the first language learned by most of the residents was Spanish (83.17%) followed by Quechua (14.78%). The following table shows the results concerning the language learnt first in the Arequipa Region by province: \n\nPoints of interest\n\nThere are numerous points of interest in the Arequipa region. The three coastal provinces, Caraveli, Camana and Islay all have popular beaches. Various ports can also be found along the coastline, the two most important being Mollendo and Matarani, both in the province of Islay.\n\nThe Colca Canyon, twice as deep as the Grand Canyon in the United States, is situated in the province of Caylloma. The Cotahuasi Canyon is in the La Union Province. Colca Valley provides incredible close-up views of majestic Andean condors soaring in their natural habitat. Cotahuasi, at 3535 m, is thought to be the deepest canyon in the world. Both canyons offer spectacular scenery and villages as yet unaffected by the modern world.\n\nIn the Castilla Province near Corire there is Toro Muerto with more than 3,000 petroglyphs.

This iconic American classic features some of the most powerful music ever written for the stage, including \u201cIf I Loved You\u201d, \u201cMister Snow\u201d, \u201cJune is Bustin Out All Over\u201d and the iconic \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone.\u201d Carousel was Rodgers and Hammerstein\u2019s second collaboration, and was adapted from Ferenc Molnar\u2019s 1909 play Lilliom.  They transferred the Budapest setting of Lilliom to the New England coastline, where Carousel takes place.  The story tells of charming, roguish carnival barker, Billy Bigelow, and mill worker Julie Jordan, both loners, who meet and fall in love.  Their marriage ends up costing both their jobs, and things go downhill from there.  Billy\u2019s desperation makes him violent against those he loves most, and drives him to commit crimes in order to provide for his family.   When Billy falls in with con-man Jigger Craigin, he ends up getting caught in the midst of an armed robbery and takes his own life.  Billy is allowed to return to earth for one day fifteen years later, and he encounters the daughter he never knew. Louise is a lonely, friendless teenager, her father's reputation having haunted her throughout her young life. How Billy instills in both the child and her mother a sense of hope and dignity is a dramatic testimony to love\u2019s transcendence.  Voted the best musical of the 20th century by Time Magazine, Rodger\u2019s and Hammerstein\u2019s Carousel is the classic American musical, spanning heaven and earth in its exploration of human frailty, resilience, and the power of forgiveness.\nCharacters\n", "context_len": 341, "questions": ["Julie Jordan and Mr Snow are both characters in which stage and film musical?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Onion skins", "Allium angolense", "Onion", "Bulb onion", "Allium nigritanum", "Onion fruit", "Kaanda", "Allium salota", "Pyaz", "Dry onion", "Allium cepa", "Garden onion", "Bulb onions", "Allium aobanum", "Onions", "Onion set", "Spanish onion"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nSinoatrial node\nThe sinoatrial node (often abbreviated SA node; also commonly called the sinus node and less commonly the sinuatrial node) is the normal natural pacemaker of the heart and is responsible for the initiation of the cardiac cycle (heartbeat). It spontaneously generates an electrical impulse, which after conducting throughout the heart, causes the heart to contract. Although the electrical impulses are generated spontaneously, the rate of the impulses (and therefore the heart rate) is set by the nerves innervating the sinoatrial node. The sinoatrial node is located in the myocardial wall near where the sinus venarum joins the right atrium (upper chamber); hence sino- + atrial. \n\nDiscovery\n\nThe sinoatrial node was first discovered by a young medical student, Martin Flack, in the heart of a mole, whilst his mentor, Sir Arthur Keith, was on a bicycle ride with his wife. They made the discovery in a makeshift laboratory set up in a picturesque farmhouse in Kent, England, called Mann's Place. Their discovery was published in 1907. \n\nStructure\n\nLocation\n\nThe sinoatrial node is composed of a group of specialised cells positioned in the wall of the right atrium just lateral to the sinus venarum at the junction where the superior vena cava enters the right atrium.  The SA node is located in the myocardium just internally to the epicardium. Its deep aspect abuts cardiac myocytes belonging to the right atrium, while its superficial aspect is covered by adipose tissue. It is an elongated structure that extends between 1 and 2\u00a0cm on the right from the crista terminalis the crest of the right atrial appendage, and runs posteroinferiorly into the upper part of the terminal groove. SA node fibres are specialized cardiomyocytes that vaguely resemble normal, contractile cardiac myocytes; however, although they possess some contractile filaments they do not contract as robustly. Additionally, SA node fibers are measurably thinner, more tortuous and stain less intensely than cardiac myocytes.\n\nInnervation\n\nThe SA node is richly innervated by parasympathetic nervous system fibers (the tenth cranial nerve (CN X: vagus nerve)) and by sympathetic nervous system fibers (T1-4, spinal nerves). This unique anatomical arrangement makes the SA node susceptible to distinctly paired and opposed autonomic influences.  At rest, the sinus rate is mostly influenced by vagal discharges or \"tone\" and on exercise mostly by adrenergic input.\n* Stimulation of the vagus nerves (the parasympathetic fibers) causes a decrease in the SA node rate (thereby  decreasing the heart rate). The parasympathetic nervous system, through the action of vagus nerve, exerts a negative inotropic effect upon the heart. \n* Stimulation via sympathetic fibers causes an increase in the SA node rate (thereby increasing the heart rate and force of contraction).  Sympathetic fibers can increase the force of contraction because in addition to innervating the SA and AV nodes, they innervate the atria and ventricles themselves.\n\nBlood supply\n\nThe SA node receives blood supply from the SA node artery. Anatomical dissection studies have shown that this supply may be branch of the right coronary artery in the majority (about 60-70%) of hearts, and a branch of the left coronary artery (usually the left circumflex artery) in about 20-30% of hearts.  Rarer variants may include blood supply from both right and left coronary arteries or two branches of the right coronary artery. \n\nFunction\n\nPacemaking\n\nAlthough some of the heart's cells have the ability to generate the electrical impulses (or action potentials) that trigger cardiac contraction, the sinoatrial node normally initiates it, simply because it generates impulses slightly faster than the other areas with pacemaker potential. Cardiomyocytes, like all muscle cells, have refractory periods following contraction during which additional contractions cannot be triggered; their pacemaker potential is overridden by the sinoatrial or atrioventricular nodes.\n \nIn the absence of extrinsic neural and hormonal control, cells in the sinoatrial node (SA node), situated in the upper right corner of the heart, will naturally discharge (create action potentials) upwards of 100 beats/minute.[http://sprojects.mmi.mcgill.ca/cardiophysio/AnatomySAnode.htm AnatomySAnode] Because the sinoatrial node is responsible for the rest of the heart's electrical activity, it is sometimes called the primary pacemaker.\n\nClinical significance\n\nSinus node dysfunction describes an irregular heartbeat caused by faulty electrical signals of the heart. When the heart's sinoatrial node is defective, the heart\u2019s rhythms become abnormal \u2013 typically too slow or exhibiting pauses in its function or a combination, and very rarely faster than normal. \n\nOcclusion of the arterial blood supply to the SA node (most commonly due to a myocardial infarction or progressive coronary artery disease) can therefore cause ischaemia and cell death in the SA node. This can disrupt the electrical pacemaker function of the SA node, and can result in sick sinus syndrome.\n\nIf the SA node does not function, or the impulse generated in the SA node is blocked before it travels down the electrical conduction system, a group of cells further down the heart will become its pacemaker.  This center is typically represented by cells inside the atrioventricular node (AV node), which is an area between the atria and ventricles, within the atrial septum.  If the AV node also fails, Purkinje fibers (or known by some as the bundle of His) are occasionally capable of acting as the default or \"escape\" pacemaker.  The reason Purkinje cells do not normally control the heart rate is that they generate action potentials at a lower frequency than the AV or SA nodes.\n\nAdditional images\n\n Image:Reizleitungssystem 1.png|Heart; conduction system (SA node labeled 1)\n Image:Gray501.png |Schematic representation of the atrioventricular bundle\n", "context_len": 1046, "questions": ["Where is the sinoatrial node?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Perfect storm (disambiguation)", "The Perfect Storm", "Perfect Storm"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

Bayonet Yucca filamentosa   \bIntroduction Adam\ufffds Needle is a slow growing native plant found scattered through the woods in the southeastern United States. Leaves appear as though they have been shaved because leaf margins bear curved, filamentous threads of leaf tissue. The leaf terminates in a sharp spine. Plants stay small, growing no more than about 3-feet-tall. In summer a tall, showy flower spike emerges from the center of the plant and displays prominently for several weeks.

Its striking texture will draw attention. It has also been planted in mass on 3- to 4-foot centers to form a ground cover effect. Locate the plant 3 to 4 feet back from the edge of a walk or patio to prevent getting injured from the spine at the tip of the leaves. Adam\ufffds Needle grows in its native habitat in well drainedsoils in mostly sunny locations. It tolerates partial shade well, provided enough air circulates to keep the plant on the dry side. There is a variegated cultivar called \ufffdVariegata\ufffd that has light yellow stripes along the margins.  Pests and Diseases No serious pests effect the plant if its cultural requirements are met.   by Edward F.

{"context": "\nChorea\nChorea (or choreia, occasionally) is an abnormal involuntary movement disorder, one of a group of neurological disorders called dyskinesias. The term chorea is derived from the Greek word \u03c7\u03bf\u03c1\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 (=dance; see choreia), as the quick movements of the feet or hands are comparable to dancing.\n\nThe term hemichorea refers to chorea of one side of the body, such as chorea of one arm but not both (analogous to hemiballismus).\n\nPresentation\n\nChorea is characterized by brief, semi-directed, irregular movements that are not repetitive or rhythmic, but appear to flow from one muscle to the next.\n\nThese 'dance-like' movements of chorea often occur with athetosis, which adds twisting and writhing movements.  Walking may become difficult, and include odd postures and leg movements.\n\nUnlike ataxia, which affects the quality of voluntary movements, or Parkinsonism, which is a hindrance of voluntary movements, the movements of chorea and ballism occur on their own, without conscious effort. Thus, chorea is said to be a hyperkinetic movement disorder.\n\nWhen chorea is serious, slight movements will become thrashing motions; this form of severe chorea is referred to as ballism or ballismus.\n\nCauses\n\nHuntington\u2019s disease\n\nHuntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disease and the commonest inherited cause of chorea. The condition was formerly called Huntington's chorea but was renamed because of the important non-choreic features including cognitive decline and behavioural change. \n\nOther genetic causes\n\nOther genetic causes of chorea are rare. They include the classical Huntington's disease 'mimic' or phenocopy syndromes, called Huntington's disease-like syndrome types 1, 2 and 3; inherited prion disease, the spinocerebellar ataxias type 1, 3 and 17, neuroacanthocytosis, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA), brain iron accumulation disorders, Wilson's disease, benign hereditary chorea, Friedreich's ataxia, mitochondrial disease and Rett syndrome. \n\nAcquired causes\n\nThe most common acquired causes of chorea are cerebrovascular disease and, in the developing world, HIV infection - usually through its association with cryptococcal disease.\n\nSydenham's chorea occurs as a complication of streptococcal infection. Twenty percent (20%) of children and adolescents with rheumatic fever develop Sydenham's chorea as a complication. It is increasingly rare, which may be partially due to penicillin, improved social conditions, and/or a natural reduction in the bacteria ( Streptococcus ) it has stemmed from.  Psychological symptoms may precede or accompany this acquired chorea and may be relapsing and remitting. The broader spectrum of paediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infection can cause chorea and are collectively referred to as PANDAS.\n\nChorea gravidarum refers to choreic symptoms that occur during pregnancy. If left untreated, the disease resolves in 30% of patients before delivery but, in the other 70%, it persists. The symptoms then progressively disappear in the next few days following the delivery.\n\nChorea may also be caused by drugs (commonly levodopa, anti-convulsants and anti-psychotics).\n\nOther acquired causes include systemic lupus erythematosus, antiphospholipid syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, polycythaemia rubra vera, transmissible spongiform encephalopathies and coeliac disease. \n\nTreatment\n\nThere is no standard course of treatment for chorea. Treatment depends on the type of chorea and the associated disease. Although there are many drugs that can control it, no cure has yet been identified.\n", "context_len": 606, "questions": ["What is the common name for Chorea, a disease characterised by irregular involuntary movements, commonly found in children?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["IMOLA", "Forum Cornelii", "Rocca Sforzesca", "\u00ccmola", "Imolensis", "Imola"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

The History Learning Site, 21 Apr 2015. 16 Aug 2016.\nThe Royal Air Force had its own gallantry medals during World War One and these were used during the Battle of Britain. Up until 1993, officers and warrant officers received different styles of medals when compared to other ranks \u2013 officers being awarded a \u2018cross\u2019 of some description while non-officers a \u2018medal\u2019 of some description. A Victoria Cross, the highest medal for gallantry in the face of the enemy in the British and Commonwealth military, was awarded only once during the Battle of Britain to James Nicolson. Other than the VC, the highest medals for valour awarded to personnel in Fighter Command during the Battle of Britain were the Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) and the Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM). The Air Force Cross and the Air Force Medal were also awarded.\n\u00a0\nThe Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) was awarded on numerous occasions during the Battle of Britain. From its inception, the Distinguished Flying Cross was only awarded to officers and warrant officers in the Royal Air Force and air forces from Commonwealth countries; non-commissioned ranks were awarded the Distinguished Flying Medal. During World War Two the Distinguished Flying Cross was also awarded to men in the Army who flew gliders during airborne attacks such as at D-Day.\n\u00a0\nThe criteria considered for the medal is for \u201can act or acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy\u201d.\n\u00a0\nThe Distinguished Flying Cross was first awarded on June 3rd 1918 and was designed by Edward Carter Preston.\n\u00a0\nIt replaced the DFM for non-commissioned officers in 1993; after this date, non-commissioned ranks received the Distinguished Flying Cross.\n\u00a0\nDuring World War Two, 20,354 DFC\u2019s were awarded \u2013 more than any other bravery award. 1,550 bars were awarded to those already holding a DFC while 45 men received a second bar to their medal. 964 honorary DFC\u2019s were awarded to aircrew from air forces that were not from the Commonwealth.\n\u00a0\nThe Distinguished Flying Medal (DFM) was awarded to non-commissioned ranks in the Royal Air Force and Commonwealth air forces \u2013 though Warrant Officers could also be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. In 1993, the Distinguished Flying Cross replaced the Distinguished Flying Medal and the DFC is now awarded to all ranks. The DFM was awarded for \u201can act or acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying in active operations against the enemy\u201d.\n\u00a0\nThe medal was introduced on June 3rd 1918.\n\u00a0\nDuring World War One, 105 DFM\u2019s were awarded.\n\u00a0\nDuring World War Two, 6,637 DFM\u2019s were awarded. Sixty of these recipents later added a bar to their medal. Only one man, Flight Sergeant Donald Kingaby, was awarded a second bar to his DFM.\n\u00a0\n165 DFM\u2019s were awarded during the war in an honorary capacity to airmen from non-Commonwealth countries.\n\u00a0\nThe Air Force Cross was introduced in June 1918 and was awarded for \u201can act or acts of valour, courage or devotion to duty whilst flying, though not in active operations against the enemy\u201d. The Air Force Cross was originally intended for RAF commissioned officers and Warrant Officers only but this was expanded after World War Two to include the Army and Navy. In 1993, in a move similar to the Distinguished Flying Cross and Distinguished Flying Medal, the Air Force Cross replaced the Air Force Medal for non-commissioned personnel.\n\u00a0\nIn World War One 680 Air Force Crosses were awarded and in World War Two 2,001 with 26 recipients adding a bar after being awarded the AFC twice. In 1944, Wing Commander H Wilson was awarded a second bar to his AFC \u2013 the only man to be honoured in this way. During World War Two, 58 honorary AFC\u2019s were awarded to non-Commonwealth personnel.\n", "context_len": 735, "questions": ["Which medal formerly for the RAF was introduced in 1918 for bravery of officers, but now is for all ranks of the service?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Archibald alec leach", "ArchibaldAlexanderLeach", "Archibald Alexander Leach", "Carygrant", "Cary Grant", "Archie Leach", "Carey Grant", "Cary Grant.", "Carry Grant", "Cary grant", "Cary grant filmography", "Cary Grant filmography"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nFarfalle\nFarfalle are a type of pasta. Commonly known as \"bow-tie pasta\", the name is derived from the Italian word farfalla (butterfly).  The \"e\" at the end of the word is the Italian feminine plural ending, making the meaning of the word \"butterflies\".\n\nFarfalle date back to the 16th century in Lombardy and Emilia-Romagna in Northern Italy.\n\nVarieties\n\nFarfalle come in several sizes, but have a distinctive bow tie shape. Usually, the farfalle are formed from a rectangle or oval of pasta with two sides trimmed in a ruffled edge, and the center pinched together to make the unusual shape of the pasta. They are sometimes ridged, known as farfalle rigate. Different varieties are available: plain, tomato, and spinach. These are often sold together in a mix, recalling the colors of the flag of Italy. Though usable with most sauces, farfalle are best suited to cream and tomato dishes.\n\nIn addition to plain and whole wheat varieties, as with any pasta, other colours can be made by mixing other ingredients into the dough, which also affects the flavour; for example, beetroot for red, spinach for green and cuttlefish ink for black.\n\nA larger variation of farfalle is known as farfallone, while there is a miniature version called farfalline.\n\nIn Modena, farfalle are known as strichetti.\n\nFarfalle are not related to the similar-sounding farfel, a kind of egg-barley pasta in Jewish cuisine.\n", "context_len": 273, "questions": ["What shape is farfalle pasta?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["2", "Two", "two"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nWhite Rabbit (Jefferson Airplane song)\n\"White Rabbit\" is a song written by Grace Slick, and recorded by the American psychedelic rock band Jefferson Airplane for their 1967 album, Surrealistic Pillow. It was released as a single and became the band's second top ten success, peaking at number eight  on the Billboard Hot 100. The song was ranked number 478 on Rolling Stones list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, Number 87 on Rate Your Music's Top Singles of All Time,  and appears on The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame's 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.\n\nHistory\n\n\u201cWhite Rabbit\u201d was written and performed by Grace Slick while she was still with The Great Society. When that band broke up in 1966, Slick was invited to join Jefferson Airplane to replace their departed female singer, Signe Toly Anderson, who left the band with the birth of her child. The first album Slick recorded with Jefferson Airplane was Surrealistic Pillow, and Slick provided two songs from her previous group: her own \u201cWhite Rabbit\u201d and \u201cSomebody to Love\u201d, written by her brother-in-law Darby Slick and recorded under the title \"Someone to Love\" by The Great Society.  Both songs became top ten hits  for Jefferson Airplane and have ever since been associated with that band.\n\nLyrics and composition\n\n\"White Rabbit\" is one of Grace Slick's earliest songs, written during either late 1965 or early 1966. It utilizes imagery found in the fantasy works of Lewis Carroll: 1865's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and its 1871 sequel Through the Looking-Glass, such as changing size after taking pills or drinking an unknown liquid. Slick had stated the composition was intended to be a slap to parents who would read their children such novels, and then wonder why their children would later use drugs.   Characters Slick referenced include Alice, the hookah-smoking caterpillar, the White Knight, the Red Queen, and the Dormouse. \n\nAlthough for Slick, White Rabbit \"is about following your curiosity. The White Rabbit is your curiosity\", for her and others in the 1960s, drugs were a part of mind-expanding and social experimentation. With its enigmatic lyrics, \"White Rabbit\" became one of the first songs to sneak drug references past censors on the radio. Even Marty Balin, Slick's eventual rival in Jefferson Airplane, regarded the song as a \"masterpiece\". In interviews, Slick has related that Alice in Wonderland was often read to her as a child, and remained a vivid memory well into her adulthood.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal Slick mentioned that in addition to Alice in Wonderland her other inspiration for the song was \"the bolero used by Miles Davis and Gil Evans on their 1960 album Sketches of Spain.\"  The song is essentially one long crescendo similar to that of Ravel's famous Bol\u00e9ro. The music combined with the song's lyrics strongly suggests the sensory distortions experienced with hallucinogens, and the song was later used in pop culture to imply or accompany just such a state. \n\nPersonnel\n\n* Grace Slick - vocals\n* Jorma Kaukonen \u2013 lead guitar \n* Paul Kantner \u2013 rhythm guitar\n* Jack Casady \u2013 bass\n* Spencer Dryden \u2013 drums\n\nCharts\n\nCashbox  (11 weeks): 59, 45, 23, 14, 12, 11, 8, 6, 7, 22, 41\n\nCovers \n\nMany artists have covered the song. Among the more notable examples are guitarist George Benson's jazz version from 1971 (featuring an electric piano solo by Herbie Hancock), and a single released in 1980 by punk/gothic rock band the Damned. A 1996 version by Icelandic singer-songwriter Emil\u00edana Torrini was used in the soundtrack for the 2011 film Sucker Punch.\n\nIn media\n\n\"White Rabbit\" has been used in numerous films and television shows. \n* In the \"A Head in the Polls\" episode of the television show Futurama, the character of Richard Nixon's head, while announcing his campaign to become president of Earth and in an attempt to broaden his political appeal, sings, \"Remember what the dormouse said: feed your head.\" Then adds, \"I'm meeting you halfway, you stupid hippies.\"\n*The song is featured in the 1997 film The Game.\n* The song is featured in the Terry Gilliam adaptation of Hunter S. Thompson's Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas (corresponding to the book's mention of the song). \n* A line in the song, \"Go Ask Alice\", was used as the title of a 1971 book about drug addiction by Beatrice Sparks that was adapted two years later into an ABC Movie of the Week.\n* What the Dormouse Said: How the Sixties Counterculture Shaped the Personal Computer Industry, by John Markoff, is a book about the development of the personal computer in the context of the collaboration-driven, World War II-era defense research community and the cooperatives and psychedelics of the American counterculture of the 1960s. \"What the Dormouse Said\" is a reference to a line at the end of the song, \"Remember what the dormouse said: feed your head.\"\n*A version, sung in Arabic by Mayssa Karaa, is heard in the 2013 movie American Hustle.\n* The song is played in The Simpsons season 10 episode 6, \"D'oh-in' in the Wind\", season 16 episode 6, \"Midnight Rx\", and season 19 episode 19, \"Mona Leaves-a\".\n* The song is played in the 1986 Academy Award winner Platoon.\n* The song is played in the Warehouse 13 season 1 episode 8 \"Duped\" when Alice (inhabiting the body of Myka Bearing) returns to the Warehouse to destroy the mirror that would trap her.\n* The song is played in the beginning and very ending of Season 1, Episode 7 of The Sopranos, titled \"Down Neck\".\n* The song is played in Supernatural season 2 episode 10 \"Hunted\".\n* The song is played in Episode 1 of the first season of \"Stranger Things\", titled \"The Vanishing of Will Byers\"\n", "context_len": 1141, "questions": ["Who followed a white rabbit down a hole?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["ARCHERY", "Toxophilite", "National Archery in the Schools Program", "Primitive archery", "Endong", "Archer (comics)", "Toxopholite", "The Archer", "Paralympic archery", "Primitive Archery", "Archery", "Archers", "Archeress", "Bowmen", "Archer", "Bowmanship", "The archer", "The Archers (disambiguation)", "Archery range", "Anchor Point (archery)", "Para-archery", "Indoor archery", "Toxophily", "Archerie", "Butt shooting", "National archery in the schools program", "Paralympic Archery", "Villavar Tamils"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

Since the 1960s, in restaurants in areas of the United States with large Italian populations, zabaione is usually served with strawberries, blueberries, peaches, etc. in a champagne glass (coupe). In France, it is called sabayon, while its Italian name is zabaione or zabaglione (or zabajone, an archaic spelling).\n\nThe dessert is popular in Argentina and Uruguay, where it is known as sambay\u00f3n. It is a popular ice cream flavour in Argentina's ice-cream shops. In Colombia, the name is sabaj\u00f3n. In Venezuela there is also a related egg-based dessert drink called ponche crema. This is consumed almost exclusively at Christmas time.\n\nPreparation\n\nClassical zabaione uses raw egg yolks, but today many may prefer to cook the custard in a bain-marie. It can be finished with beaten egg white (meringue) or sometimes by whipped cream.\n\nOccasionally, the wine is omitted when the dish is served to children or those who abstain from alcohol. It is then in effect a very different dessert. It may then be sometimes flavoured with a small amount of espresso.\n", "context_len": 275, "questions": ["Zabaglione is an Italian dessert made from eggs, sugar and which fortified wine ?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Fedallah", "Timor Tim", "Dagoo", "Moby-Dick: Captain Ahab", "Moby Dick; or, The Whale", "Ahab's Wife, Or, The Star-Gazer", "Moby-dick", "Moby Dick: Captain Ahab", "Fast-Fish and Loose-Fish", "Tashtego", "Call me Ishmael", "Moby-Dick (character)", "Moby-Dick", "Moby-Dick; or, The White Whale", "Starbuck: Moby Dick", "Moby dick", "Moby-Dick; or, The Whale", "Moby Dick (Novel)", "Starbuck (Moby-Dick)", "Ahabian", "Moby Dick", "MobyDick", "Moby-Dick (novel)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nChristine Collins\nChristine Ida Collins (December 14, 1888 - December 8, 1964)  was an American woman who made national headlines during the late 1920s and 1930s, after her 9-year-old son, Walter Collins, went missing in 1928.\n\nIt was revealed that her son was murdered in the Wineville Chicken Coop Murders led by a man named Gordon Northcott, who was executed at San Quentin in 1930.\n\nHer search for the whereabouts of her son were chronicled in the 2008 Clint Eastwood film Changeling, in which she was portrayed by Angelina Jolie. Jolie was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as Collins.\n\nEarly life\n\nShe was the daughter of Clara (n\u00e9e Horn 1851-1923) and Francis \"Frank\" Dunne (1839-1912). Her mother was an immigrant from England, and her father was from Ireland. Her father was a shipman, and the family had lived in Hawaii and California before settling in Seattle. She had several sisters and a brother. \n\nHer family chose to stay in Seattle, but Christine chose to live in California, where she was born. She worked as a manager for the telephone company. She met a conman and robber named Walter Anson, who used a pseudonym of Walter Collins or Conrad Collins. He worked for the streetcar system. They married and had a son in 1918, living in the Lincoln Heights area of Los Angeles. Her husband was sentenced to Folsom State Prison, where he died in 1932. She was heartbroken at the news of his death, and he was buried in the prison cemetery.\n\nDisappearance of Walter Collins\n\nWalter Collins went missing on March 10, 1928,  after having been given money by his mother to go to the cinema. His disappearance received nationwide attention, and the Los Angeles Police Department followed up on hundreds of leads without success.  The police faced negative publicity and increasing public pressure to solve the case,  until five months after Walter's disappearance, when a boy claiming to be Walter was found in DeKalb, Illinois. Letters and photographs were exchanged before Christine Collins paid for the boy to be brought to Los Angeles.\n\nA public reunion was organized by the police, who hoped to negate the bad publicity they received for their inability to solve this case and others. They also hoped the uplifting human-interest story would deflect attention from a series of corruption scandals that had sullied the department's reputation. At the reunion, Christine Collins claimed that the boy was not Walter. She was told by the officer in charge of the case, police Captain J.J Jones, to take the boy home to \"try him out for a couple of weeks,\" and Collins agreed.\n\nChristine Collins persisted in her claim that the boy was not Walter. Even though she was armed with dental records proving her case, Jones had Collins committed to the psychiatric ward at Los Angeles County Hospital under a \"Code 12\" internment\u2014a term used to jail or commit someone who was deemed difficult or an inconvenience.\n\nDuring Collins' incarceration, Jones questioned the boy, who admitted to being 12-year-old Arthur Hutchins Jr., a runaway from Iowa.  Hutchens was picked up by police in Illinois and when asked if he was Walter Collins, he first said no, but then said yes. His motive for posing as Collins was to get to Hollywood so he could meet his favorite actor, Tom Mix. Collins was released ten days after Hutchins admitted that he was not her son  and filed a lawsuit against the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nCollins went on to win a lawsuit against Jones and was awarded $10,800, which Jones never paid. Five years after Northcott's execution, one of the boys that Northcott allegedly killed was found alive and well. As Walter Collins' body had not been found, Christine Collins still hoped that Walter had survived. She continued to search for him for the rest of her life, but unsuccessfully - eventually she faded into obscurity without ever knowing her son's fate.  The last public record of Christine Collins is from 1941, when she attempted to collect a $15,562 judgment against Captain Jones, by then a retired police officer, in the Superior Court. \n\nLater life\n\nShe used aliases to stay out of the media, and lived alone through the 1950s.

{"context": "\nAustrian schilling\nThe Schilling (German: \u00d6sterreichischer Schilling) was the currency of Austria from 1925 to 1938 and from 1945 to 1999, and the circulating currency until 2002. The euro was introduced at a fixed parity of  \u20ac1 = 13.7603 Schilling to replace it. The Schilling was divided into 100 Groschen.\n\nHistory\n\nFirst Schilling\n\nThe Schilling was established by the Schilling Act (Schillingrechnungsgesetz) of December 20, 1924 at a rate of 1 Schilling to 10,000 Austro-Hungarian Kronen and issued on March 1, 1925. The Schilling was abolished in the wake of the Anschluss (1938), when it was exchanged at a rate of 2 German Reichsmark to 3 Schilling.\n\nSecond Schilling\n\nThe Schilling was reintroduced after World War II on November 30, 1945 by the Allied Military, who issued paper money (dated 1944) in denominations of 50 Groschen up to 100 Schilling. The exchange rate to the Reichsmark was 1:1, limited to 150 Schilling per person. The Nationalbank also began issuing Schilling notes in 1945 and the first coins were issued in 1946.\n\nWith a second \"Schilling\" law on November 21, 1947, new banknotes were introduced. The earlier notes could be exchanged for new notes at par for the first 150 Schilling and at a rate of 1 new Schilling for 3 old Schilling thereafter. Coins were not affected by this reform. The currency stabilised in the 1950s, with the Schilling being tied to the U.S. dollar at a rate of $1 = 26 Schilling. Following the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system in 1971, the Schilling was initially tied to a basket of currencies and then, in July 1976, the Schilling was coupled to the German mark.\n\nAlthough the Euro became the official currency of Austria in 1999, euro coins and notes were not introduced until 2002. Old Schilling denominated coins and notes were phased out from circulation because of the introduction of the euro by 28 February of that year. Schilling banknotes and coins which were valid at the time of the introduction of the euro will remain exchangeable for euros at any branch of the Austrian National Bank (\u00d6sterreichische Nationalbank) indefinitely.\n\nCoins\n\nFirst Schilling\n\nIn 1925, bronze 1 and 2 Groschen, cupro-nickel 10 groschen, and silver  and 1 Schilling coins were introduced, followed by cupro-nickel 5 Groschen issues in 1931. In 1934, cupro-nickel 50 Groschen and 1 Schilling were introduced, together with silver 5 Schilling. Coins were issued until 1938.\n\nSecond Schilling\n\nBetween 1947 and 1952, coins in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 Groschen; and 1, 2, and 5 Schilling were introduced. The 2 and 50 Groschen; 1, 2, and 5 Schilling were struck in aluminium, as was the second type of 10 groschen coin. The 1 and 5 groschen and the first type of 10 groschen were in zinc, with the 20 groschen struck in aluminium-bronze. The 1 groschen was only struck in 1947, while the 20 groschen and 2 Schilling coins were suspended from production in 1954 and 1952, respectively. In 1957, silver 10 Schilling coins were introduced, followed in 1959 by aluminium-bronze 50 groschen and 1 Schilling, and in 1960 by silver 5 Schilling coins. Thus, the 5 Schilling coins went from an aluminium composition to a silver one, a highly unusual event made possible by the substantial improvement of the Austrian economy in the 1950s. Cupro-nickel replaced silver in the 5 and 10 Schilling coins in 1969 and 1974, respectively. An aluminium-bronze 20 Schilling coin was introduced in 1980.\n\nSilver coins were in the value of 25, 50, 100, 200 and 500 Schilling, but gold coins also existed for 500 and 1,000 Schilling. They were considered legal currency, but were rarely found in actual transactions. \n\nAt the time of the changeover to the euro, the coins in circulation were the following. Coins under 10 groschen were rarely seen in circulation during their final years.\n\n# 10 Schilling has pure nickel core\n# Smoothly with 19 pits until 1992. In 1993, all previous 20 Schilling coins were reissued with smooth edges.\n\nBanknotes\n\nFirst Schilling\n\nIn 1925, notes were introduced by the Austrian National Bank in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 and 1,000 Schillinge (note the different spelling of the plural on this first 1925-series of notes). \n\nIn 1927\u20131929 a second series was added with 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 Schilling notes. The one Schilling was substituted by a coin.\n\nSecond Schilling\n\nIn 1945, the Allies introduced notes (dated 1944) in denominations of 50 groschen, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25, 50, 100 and 1,000 Schilling.  The National Bank also introduced notes in 1945, in denominations of 10, 20, 100 and 1,000 Schilling and the allied currency with smale values up to 5 Schilling remained valid until 1947. With the banknote reform of 1947, new notes were issued in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100 and 1,000 Schilling. \nUntil 1957, the first 500 Schilling banknote was issued and the 5 and 10 Schilling notes were replaced by coins. However, although 20 Schilling coins were issued from 1980, the 20 Schilling note continued to be produced, with 5,000 Schilling notes added in 1988.\n", "context_len": 990, "questions": ["What was the currency of Austria before the Euro"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Baby Buggy", "Baby buggy"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

Its source is near the village Zotiko, in the southwestern part of the Ioannina regional unit it flows into the Ionian Sea in Ammoudia, near Parga.\n\nMythology\n\nIn ancient Greek mythology, Acheron was known as the \"river of woe\", and was one of the five rivers of the Greek underworld.  In the Homeric poems the Acheron was described as a river of Hades, into which Cocytus and Phlegethon both flowed.  \n\nThe Roman poet Virgil called it the principal river of Tartarus, from which the Styx and Cocytus both sprang.   The newly dead would be ferried across the Acheron by Charon in order to enter the Underworld.   \n\nThe Suda describes the river as \"a place of healing, not a place of punishment, cleansing and purging the sins of humans.\" \n\nAccording to later traditions, Acheron had been a son of Helios and either Gaia or Demeter, who had been turned into the Underworld river bearing his name after he refreshed the Titans with drink during their contest with Zeus.  By this myth, Acheron is also the father of Ascalaphus by either Orphne  or Gorgyra. \n\nThe river called Acheron with the nearby ruins of the Necromanteion is found near Parga on the mainland opposite Corfu. Another branch of Acheron was believed to surface at the Acherusian cape (now Karadeniz Ere\u011fli in Turkey) and was seen by the Argonauts according to Apollonius of Rhodes. Greeks who settled in Italy identified the Acherusian lake into which Acheron flowed with Lake Avernus. Plato in his Phaedo identified Acheron as the second greatest river in the world, excelled only by Oceanus.\n\nHe claimed that Acheron flowed in the opposite direction from Oceanus beneath the earth under desert places.\nThe word is also occasionally used as a synecdoche for Hades itself. Virgil mentions Acheron with the other infernal rivers in his description of the underworld in Book VI of the Aeneid. In Book VII, line 312  he gives to Juno the famous saying, flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo: 'If I cannot bend the will of Heaven, I shall move Hell.' The same words were used by Sigmund Freud as the dedicatory motto for his seminal book The Interpretation of Dreams, figuring Acheron as psychological underworld beneath the conscious mind.\n\nThe Acheron was sometimes referred to as a lake or swamp in Greek literature, as in Aristophanes' The Frogs and Euripides' Alcestis.\n\nIn Dante's Inferno, the Acheron river forms the border of Hell. Following Greek mythology, Charon ferries souls across this river to Hell. Those who were neutral in life sit on the banks.\n\nGallery\n\nFile:Acheron 2.jpg|Acheron river\nFile:Acheron 3.jpg\nFile:Baileybridge over the Acheron river in Gliki - Greece.jpg|Truss bridge over the Acheron river\nFile:Remiz_pendulinus_nest_in_Greece.jpg|Eurasian penduline tit nest above the river\n", "context_len": 544, "questions": ["\u2018The River of Woe\u2019 is the nickname of which Underworld river in Greek mythology?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Wutherin heights", "Wuthering", "Thrushcross Grange", "Wuthering Heights", "Wuthering heights", "Frances Earnshaw"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nWhat is the function of Calcaneus bone? - InnovateUs\nWhat is the function of Calcaneus bone?\nWhat is the function of Calcaneus bone?\nSave\nThe word Calcaneus is derived from the Latin word calcaneum meaning heel. Hence Calcaneus refers to the heel bone. The Calcaneus bone is the largest tarsal bone and is located in the lower and rear part of the foot. It is irregular in shape and has 6 surfaces, each surface extending into different critical ligaments and muscles of the feet. There are an alarming number of cases of calcaneal fracture, Calcaneus spur and heel pain owing to lifestyle, accidents, trauma , obesity and improper walking.\nContent\n\u00a0\nWhat is the function of the Calcaneus bone?\nSince the Calcaneus bone is located at the rear portion of the foot (also called as heel), it is most vital in bearing the weight of the body as we stand on our feet, supporting the leg and helping in easy walking. It acts as a joint between the ankle and the foot and also as the source for various muscle joints and nerves. Other functions like rotating and bending the feet are possible due to the joint present on the Calcaneus bone. Until all the joints and tendons leading to the Calcaneus are functioning well, there is no problem in walking, standing or other functions of the foot. The tendon which is a band of tissues connecting the muscles and bones forms the crux of normal operations of the organs of the body. Example: The Achilles tendon , Calcaneus You do not have access to view this node.\nWhat is the physical structure of the Calcaneus bone?\nThe Calcaneus bone is the largest bone of the foot and is located at the lower and rear part of the foot linking the ankle to the feet. The Calcaneus bone is irregularly shaped and has 6 important surfaces. Each surface extends into an important part of the foot, ankle and heel and thus every bit of the Calcaneus bone needs to be in perfect condition for us to walk properly. The surfaces of the Calcaneus bone are the superior surface, the posterior articular surface, the middle articular surface, the anterior articular surface, the inferior surface and the lateral surface. The Calcaneus bone connects two bones namely the talus and cuboid which essentially mean the ankle bone and the body of the feet.\nWhat are the various problems that can affect the Calcaneus bone?\nThe Calcaneus bone is a very sensitive bone and since it extends into muscles , ligaments and joints of the foot, any small accident or pressure can lead to damage in its surfaces and can lead to fracture, pain or tear. Further more another common problem seen is the calcaneal spur. The calcaneal spur problem is observed in people who exert more pressure on their heel bone or sole of the feet. This causes a small bone growth on the Calcaneus You do not have access to view this node. This is a very painful situation and can result in the patient not able to even lift small weights or do daily duties properly due to restricted and painful movement while walking. This sharp pain is usually observed not only in people who are athletes or people with stand-up jobs but also in overweight people and middle aged people whose feet have kind of worn out.\n\u00a0\nWhat are the solutions to reduce pain in Calcaneus bone?\nRest, painkillers and light massages also help reduce the pain to a great extent but in overweight people, the doctor may prescribe weight reduction as the only way to cure calcaneal spur.\nOther solutions include injections and also in some cases operation. Likewise heel pain is also a common complaint among people especially women who wear heels or simply stand for long periods of time on bare feet. Such problems are also cured with proper rest, medication and permanent relief methods like weight loss, regular exercises and light massages . However, unless an orthopedician is consulted for problems arising in the Calcaneus You do not have access to view this node, self medication should never be done and the problem itself should not be ignored.\nApart from these two problems, calcaneal fracture and ligament tear are also very widely seen health issues. Fracture occurs when any accident or pressure gets applied on the sensitive tissue bands surrounding the calcaneal bone and they give way for distortion or tearing of the ligament. Such cases are treated with You do not have access to view this node, medication, dressing and rest.\n", "context_len": 828, "questions": ["The word calcaneal refers to which part of the body?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Giblets", "Giblet"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nThomas A. Dorsey\nThomas Andrew Dorsey (July 1, 1899 \u2013 January 23, 1993) was known as \"the father of black gospel music\" and was at one time so closely associated with the field that songs written in the new style were sometimes known as \"dorseys.\"  Earlier in his life he was a leading blues pianist known as Georgia Tom. \n\nAs formulated by Dorsey, gospel music combines Christian praise with the rhythms of jazz and the blues. His conception also deviates from what had been, to that time, standard hymnal practice by referring explicitly to the self, and the self's relation to faith and God, rather than the individual subsumed into the group via belief. Dorsey, who was born in Villa Rica, Georgia, was the music director at Pilgrim Baptist Church in Chicago, Illinois from 1932 until the late 1970s. His best-known composition, \"Take My Hand, Precious Lord\", was performed by Mahalia Jackson and was a favorite of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.. Another composition, \"Peace in the Valley\", was a hit for Red Foley in 1951 and has been performed by dozens of other artists, including Queen of Gospel Albertina Walker, Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash. \n\nDorsey died in Chicago, aged 93. In 2002, the Library of Congress honored his album Precious Lord: New Recordings of the Great Songs of Thomas A. Dorsey (1973), by adding it to the United States National Recording Registry.\n\nLife and career\n\nDorsey's father was a minister and his mother a piano teacher. He learned to play blues piano as a young man. After studying music formally in Chicago, he became an agent for Paramount Records. He put together a band for Ma Rainey called the \"Wild Cats Jazz Band\" in 1924. He started out playing at rent parties with the names Barrelhouse Tom and Texas Tommy, but he was most famous as Georgia Tom. For a short time around 1926, he accompanied the Pace Jubilee Singers.  As Georgia Tom, he teamed up with Tampa Red (Hudson Whittaker) with whom he recorded the raunchy 1928 hit record \"It's Tight Like That\", a sensation, eventually selling seven million copies.  In all, he is credited with more than 400 blues and jazz songs. Dorsey began recording gospel music alongside blues in the mid-1920s. This led to his performing at the National Baptist Convention in 1930, and becoming the bandleader of two churches in the early 1930s. \n\nHis first wife, Nettie, who had been Rainey's wardrobe mistress, died in childbirth in 1932. Two days later the child, a son, also died. In his grief, he wrote his most famous song, one of the most famous of all gospel songs, \"Precious Lord, Take My Hand\".  Unhappy with the treatment received at the hands of established publishers, Dorsey opened the first black gospel music publishing company, Dorsey House of Music. He also founded his own gospel choir and was a founder and first president of the National Convention of Gospel Choirs and Choruses.\n\nHis influence was not limited to African American music, as white musicians also followed his lead. \"Precious Lord\" has been recorded by Albertina Walker, Elvis Presley, Mahalia Jackson, Aretha Franklin, B.B. King, Clara Ward, Dorothy Norwood, Jim Reeves, Roy Rogers, and Tennessee Ernie Ford, and Johnny Cash among hundreds of others. It was a favorite gospel song of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., and was sung at the rally held at the Imani Temple the night before his assassination, and, per his request, at his funeral by Mahalia Jackson. It was also a favorite of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who requested it to be sung at his funeral. Dorsey was also a great influence on other Chicago-based gospel artists such as Albertina Walker and The Caravans and Little Joey McClork.\n\nDorsey wrote \"Peace in the Valley\" for Mahalia Jackson in 1937, which also became a gospel standard. He was the first African American elected to the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame and also the first in the Gospel Music Association's Living Hall of Fame. In 2007, he was inducted as a charter member of the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in Richmond, Indiana. His papers are preserved at Fisk University, along with those of W.C. Handy, George Gershwin, and the Fisk Jubilee Singers. Dorsey's works have proliferated beyond performance, into the hymnals of virtually all American churches and of English-speaking churches worldwide. Thomas was a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity. He died in Chicago, Illinois, and was interred there in the Oak Woods Cemetery.\n", "context_len": 888, "questions": ["The Reverend Thomas A Dorsey is linked with the origins of what musical singing style?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Edvard munch", "Edward munch", "Death In the Sickroom", "Edvvard Munch", "Frieze of Life", "Edvard Munch", "Edward Munch"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nSymphony No. 45 (Haydn)\nSymphony No. 45 in F-sharp minor, known as the \"Farewell\" Symphony (in , modern orthography: ), was composed by Joseph Haydn and dated 1772 on the autograph score. \n\nHistory\n\nThe tale of how the symphony was composed is widely recounted; it was told by Haydn in old age to his biographers Albert Christoph Dies and Georg August Griesinger. \n\nWhen the symphony was written, Haydn's patron Prince Nikolaus Esterh\u00e1zy was resident, together with all his musicians and retinue, at his favorite summer palace at Eszterh\u00e1za in rural Hungary. The stay there had been longer than expected, and most of the musicians had been forced to leave their wives back at home in Eisenstadt, about a day's journey away. Longing to return, the musicians appealed to their Kapellmeister for help. The diplomatic Haydn, instead of making a direct appeal, put his request into the music of the symphony: during the final adagio each musician stops playing, snuffs out the candle on his music stand, and leaves in turn, so that at the end, there are just two muted violins left (played by Haydn himself and his concertmaster, Luigi Tomasini). Esterh\u00e1zy seems to have understood the message: the court returned to Eisenstadt the day following the performance. \n\nThe music\n\nKey\n\nThe work is in F sharp minor. According to Webster, this choice was unusual, indeed the Farewell Symphony is apparently the only 18th century symphony ever written in this key. \n\nThe symphony could not be performed without the purchase of some special equipment:  on 22 October 1772 Haydn signed an order (preserved in the scrupulously maintained Esterh\u00e1zy archives) for two special half-step slides (German \"Halbth\u00f6nige Krummb\u00f6gen\") for use by the horn players. These slightly lengthened the horn's tubing, permitting the instrument to be used to play in keys a half-step lower than usual.  (The horn of the time was the valveless natural horn, which needed to be adjusted with inserted crooks to play in different keys.) Haydn's purchase order is part of the evidence that the symphony was completed in the Fall of 1772. \n\nMovements\n\nThe piece is written for two oboes, bassoon, two horns, and strings (violins in two sections, violas, cellos and double basses).\n\n# Allegro assai, 3/4\n# Adagio, 3/8\n# Menuet: Allegretto, 3/4\n# Finale: Presto, 2/2 \u2013 Adagio, 3/8\n\nThe turbulent first movement of the work opens in a manner typical of Haydn's Sturm und Drang period, with descending minor arpeggios in the first violins against syncopated notes in the second violins and held chords in the winds. The movement can be explained structurally in terms of sonata form, but it departs from the standard model in a number of ways (just before the recapitulation, for example, new material is introduced, which might have been used as the second subject in the exposition in a more conventional work). Also, the exposition moves to C-sharp minor, the dominant minor, rather than the more usual relative major. \n\nThe second, slow, movement in A major and 3/8 time is also in sonata form. It begins with a relaxed melody played by muted violins, featuring a repeated \"hiccuping\" motif. The mood gradually becomes more somber and meditative with an alternation between major and minor modes, resembling many similar passages in the later work of Schubert. There follows a series of dissonant suspensions carried across the bar line, which are extended to extraordinary lengths by Haydn when the same material appears in the recapitulation. James Webster   hears this music as programmatic, expressing the yearning for home.\n\nThe following minuet is in the key of F-sharp major; its main peculiarity is that the final cadence of each section is made very weak (falling on the third beat), creating a sense of incompleteness.\n\nThe last movement begins as a characteristic Haydn finale in fast tempo and cut time, written in sonata form in the home key of F-sharp minor. The rhythmic intensity is increased at one point through the use of unison bariolage in the first violin part. The music eventually reaches the end of the recapitulation in a passage that sounds very much as if it were the end of the symphony, but suddenly breaks off in a dominant cadence.\n\nWhat follows is a long coda-like section, in essence a second slow movement, which is highly unusual in Classical symphonies and was probably quite surprising to the Prince. This is written in 3/8 time, modulates from A major to F-sharp major, and includes a bit of stage business that may not be obvious to a listener hearing a recorded performance: Several of the musicians are given little solos to play, after which they snuff out the candle on their music stand and take their leave; other musicians leave without solos. The order of departure is: first oboe and second horn (solos), bassoon (no solo), second oboe and first horn (solos), double bass (solo), cello (no solo), orchestral violins (solos; first chair players silent), viola (no solo). As the number of remaining instruments dwindles, the sound emanating from the orchestra gradually becomes audibly thinner. The first chair violinists remain to complete the work. The ending is a kind of deliberate anticlimax and is usually performed as a very soft pianissimo.\n\nA typical performance of the \"Farewell\" Symphony lasts around twenty-five minutes.\n\nReception\n\nThe work is probably one of the more familiar and frequently performed of the symphonies from the earlier period of Haydn's career.  Haydn himself quoted the opening of the first movement in his  Symphony No. 85, suggesting he knew that his audience would recognize it.  For the musicologist James Webster, the work deserves its fame not so much for its affiliated anecdote but rather in its own right as superlative music, and he devoted to it a substantial book (Webster 1991) analyzing it in great detail and placing it in its musicological context.\n", "context_len": 1133, "questions": ["\"How many musicians are left at the end of Haydon's \"\"Farewell Symphony\"\"\""], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["House of Peers of the United Kingdom", "United Kingdom House of Peers", "House Of Lords", "The Right Honourable The Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament Assembled", "Lords Spiritual and Temporal", "House of Lords of the United Kingdom", "Noble friend", "House of LORDS", "House of Lords, Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland", "House of Lords of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland", "House of Lords (UK)", "The Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled", "The House of Lords", "United Kingdom House of Lords", "English House of Lords", "House of Lords", "House of lords", "House of Lords, Parliament of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland", "House of Peers of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland", "House of Lords (United Kingdom)", "UKHL", "Gilded Chamber", "British House of Lords"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nCannon and Ball\nTommy Cannon (born Thomas Derbyshire, 27 June 1938) and Bobby Ball (born Robert Harper, 28 January 1944), known collectively as Cannon and Ball, are an English comedy double act best known for their comedy variety show The Cannon and Ball Show, which lasted for nine years on ITV.  The duo met in the early 1960s while working as welders in Oldham, Lancashire.  They started out as singers working the pubs and clubs of Greater Manchester and switched to comedy after being told comics earned an extra \u00a33 a night.\n\nTV and film\n\nTheir first TV appearance was in 1974 in the variety show The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club before landing a performance on Bruce Forsyth's Big Night, although their segment didn't make it to broadcast. In 1979, LWT offered them their own series, The Cannon and Ball Show  which premiered in ITV on 28 July 1979. Further series followed each year through to 1988, along with Christmas and Easter specials.\n\nIn 1982, they appeared in a feature film, The Boys in Blue,  based loosely on the classic Will Hay film, Ask a Policeman.  The Boys in Blue was regarded critically as weak in comparison and was their only cinema outing. It was released on DVD in 2004.\n\nThey also featured in a comic strip Rock on Tommy, which was published in the magazine Look-in.\n\nTheir popularity coincided with the rise of alternative comedy, with its emphasis on more socially relevant and political concerns. As time passed, Cannon and Ball's popularity began to decline, though they were not the only comedy act to suffer as comic tastes shifted. During the 1980s, Greg Dyke, the then Head of Programming at ITV station TVS and later to hold a similar position at LWT expressed a concern that northern comedy shows may not suit southern tastes.\n\nBy the 1990s, the duo were seeking a change in direction and appeared in their own sitcom Cannon and Balls Playhouse, the spin-off series Plaza Patrol  and their game show Cannon and Ball's Casino. Plaza Patrol saw them play security guards in a shopping mall.\n\nCatchphrases:- \"Rock on Tommy!\", \"That'll do for me cocker!\", \"You little liar!\", \"Deep down, you really hate me don't yer!\", \"Aww, look at it!\", \"I'm dead excited!\", \"You've got me skin!\", \"Pick up the piggin' phone\", \"'S a meeting!\".\n\nRecent\n\nIn more recent times, they have continued to find success as a comic duo in theatre and pantomime, along with numerous cameo appearances on TV.  In late 2005, they appeared in the British reality TV series I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!.\n\nIn recent years, they have admitted that, during their hey-day of huge popularity in the 1980s, they were barely on speaking terms and would avoid each other completely when not on stage or rehearsing.  These tensions \u2013 which lasted for years \u2013 were later resolved and the two are now extremely close once again.\n\nIn 2010, they were panellists on BBC Radio 4 comedy panel show Act Your Age radio series. They appeared in a celebrity edition of Coach Trip on Channel 4 in 2012. \n\nTours\n\nThe pair revived a touring version of the theatrical farce Big Bad Mouse, originally a highly successful vehicle for Jimmy Edwards and Eric Sykes in the 1960s and 1970s. The latest incarnation of the show featured Cannon and Ball in the starring roles, supported by Allo Allos Sue Hodge as Lady Chesapeake and newcomer Emily Trebicki as secretary Miss Spencer. The show opened in Hull during May 2008 and toured six other cities, before ending in August at the Theatre Royal, Windsor, to mixed reviews.\n\nReligion\n\nThe pair are devout Christians and published a book called Christianity for Beginners.  Ball became a born-again Christian in 1986 and Cannon in 1992, their conversion having a lot to do with the re-kindling of their broken friendship. They now regularly feature in their own gospel and \"an audience with...\" show in churches around the country.  \n\nOther work\n\nAlso in 2008, the pair's career continued as they appeared on television as the faces of Safestyle UK, a Bradford based double glazing firm.  The pair have starred in pantomimes at the Theatre Royal, Lincoln including Robin Hood, Dick Whittington, Cinderella and in 2014 appeared in Jack and the Beanstalk.\n", "context_len": 843, "questions": ["How are the comedians Thomas Derbyshire and Robert Harper better known?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight", "1948"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nCornucopia\nThe cornucopia (from Latin cornu copiae) or horn of plenty is a symbol of abundance and nourishment, commonly a large horn-shaped container overflowing with produce, flowers or nuts. The horn originates from classical antiquity, it has continued as a symbol in Western art, and it is particularly associated with the Thanksgiving holiday in North America.\n\nIn mythology\n\nMythology offers multiple explanations of the origin of the cornucopia. One of the best-known involves the birth and nurturance of the infant Zeus, who had to be hidden from his devouring father Kronus. In a cave on Mount Ida on the island of Crete, baby Zeus was cared for and protected by a number of divine attendants, including the goat Amalthea (\"Nourishing Goddess\"), who fed him with her milk. The suckling future king of the gods had unusual abilities and strength, and in playing with his nursemaid accidentally broke off one of her horns, which then had the divine power to provide unending nourishment, as the foster mother had to the god. \n\nIn another myth, the cornucopia was created when Heracles (Roman Hercules) wrestled with the river god Achelous and wrenched off one of his horns; river gods were sometimes depicted as horned.  This version is represented in the Achelous and Hercules mural painting by the American Regionalist artist Thomas Hart Benton.\n\nThe cornucopia became the attribute of several Greek and Roman deities, particularly those associated with the harvest, prosperity, or spiritual abundance, such as personifications of Earth (Gaia or Terra); the child Plutus, god of riches and son of the grain goddess Demeter; the nymph Maia; and Fortuna, the goddess of luck, who had the power to grant prosperity. In Roman Imperial cult, abstract Roman deities who fostered peace (pax Romana) and prosperity were also depicted with a cornucopia, including Abundantia, \"Abundance\" personified, and Annona, goddess of the grain supply to the city of Rome. Pluto, the classical ruler of the underworld in the mystery religions, was a giver of agricultural, mineral and spiritual wealth, and in art often holds a cornucopia to distinguish him from the gloomier Hades, who holds a drinking horn instead. \n\nModern depictions\n\nIn modern depictions, the cornucopia is typically a hollow, horn-shaped wicker basket filled with various kinds of festive fruit and vegetables. In most of North America, the cornucopia has come to be associated with Thanksgiving and the harvest.  Cornucopia is also the name of the annual November Food and Wine celebration in Whistler, British Columbia, Canada.  Two cornucopias are seen in the flag and state seal of Idaho.  The Great Seal of North Carolina depicts Liberty standing and Plenty holding a cornucopia.  The coat of arms of Colombia, Panama, Peru and Venezuela, and the Coat of Arms of the State of Victoria, Australia, also feature the cornucopia, symbolising prosperity. In the book and film series The Hunger Games, the Cornucopia is filled with weapons, and is the starting point of the Games, and it is also the name of the Anthem of Panem.\n\nThe horn of plenty is used for body art and at Halloween, as it is a symbol of fertility, fortune and abundance. \n\nGallery\n\nFile:Coat of arms of Colombia.svg|Coat of arms of Colombia\nFile:Pfarrkirchen - Deckenfresco - Lauretanische Litanei - Engel mit F\u00fcllhorn.jpg|Angel with cornucopia\nFile:Corne d'Abondance Statue Louis XV Reims 270608 1.jpg|Base of a statue ofLouis XV of France\nFile:Escudo de Copiap\u00f3.svg|Coat of arms ofCopiap\u00f3, Chile\nFile:Seal of North Carolina.svg|Seal of North Carolina\nFile:Cornucopia kitsch.jpg|Cornucopia as an object used in interior decoration \nFile:Jacob Jordaens- Al\u00b7legoria de la Pau.jpg|Allegory of peace and happiness of the state.

{"context": "\nShall We Dance? (1996 film)\nis a 1996 Japanese film. Its title refers to the song, \"Shall We Dance?\" which comes from Rodgers and Hammerstein's The King and I. It was directed by Masayuki Suo.\n\nPlot\n\nThe film begins with a close-up of the inscription above the stage in the ballroom of the Blackpool Tower: \"Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear\", from the poem Venus and Adonis by William Shakespeare. As the camera pans around the ballroom giving a view of the dancers, a voice-over explains that in Japan, ballroom dancing is treated with suspicion.\n\nShohei Sugiyama (K\u014dji Yakusho) is a successful salaryman, with a house in the suburbs, a devoted wife, Masako (Hideko Hara), and a teenage daughter, Chikage (Ayano Nakamura). He works as an accountant for a firm in Tokyo. Despite these external signs of success, however, Sugiyama begins to feel as if his life has lost direction and meaning and falls into depression.\n\nOne night, while coming home on the Tokyo Subway, he spots a beautiful woman with a melancholy expression looking out from a window in a dance studio. This is Mai Kishikawa (Tamiyo Kusakari), a well-known figure on the Western ballroom dance circuit. Sugiyama becomes infatuated with her and decides to take lessons in order to get to know her better.\n\nSugiyama's life changes once his classes begin. Rather than Mai, his teacher is Tamako Tamura (Reiko Kusamura), who becomes an important mentor to him. He meets his classmates: T\u014dkichi Hattori (Yu Tokui) who joined to impress his wife, and Masahiro Tanaka (Hiromasa Taguchi) who joined to lose weight. He also meets Toyoko Takahashi (Eriko Watanabe), another student. He further discovers that one of his colleagues from work Tomio Aoki (Naoto Takenaka) is a regular at the dance studio. Aoki, who is balding and mocked at work for his rigid ways, is revealed to be leading a secret life as a long-haired (via a wig) ballroom dancer. Though distant from her, the classes increase his infatuation for Mai. His secret thus becomes twofold: not only must he hide the lessons from his wife, he must also hide them from his friends and colleagues as it is considered embarrassing according to traditional Japanese customs to participate in Western ballroom dance.\n\nLater, after being rebuffed by Mai, Sugiyama discovers to his surprise that his passion for ballroom dance outweighs his infatuation with her. Indeed, dancing, rather than Mai, gives Sugiyama the meaning in life that he was looking for.\n\nMasako, noticing his odd behavior, thinks that he is having an affair \u2014 so she hires a private detective to follow him. Meanwhile, along with his classmates, Sugiyama enters an amateur competition \u2013 only to find out that his wife, having finally learned the truth from the detective (who has now become a devoted fan of ballroom dancing) is in the audience. Surprised by this, he stumbles and nearly knocks his dance partner to the floor. Though he is able to catch her, he accidentally rips the skirt of her dress off. Both leave the contest. Later, they learn that Tomio won the contest. When Tomio is ridiculed at work after his colleagues read of his success in the newspaper, Sugiyama stands up and tells them not to make fun of something they don't understand.\n\nAt home, Sugiyama's wife tries to understand her husband's new passion by asking him to teach her to dance as well. He is invited to a good-bye party for Mai, who is leaving for Blackpool. At the party, Mai joins him to dance, asking him \"Shall we dance?\"\n\nCast \n\n*K\u014dji Yakusho - Shohei Sugiyama\n*Tamiyo Kusakari - Mai Kishikawa\n*Naoto Takenaka - Tomio Aoki\n*Eriko Watanabe - Toyoko Takahashi \n*Yu Tokui - Tokichi Hattori\n*Hiromasa Taguchi - Masahiro Tanaka\n*Reiko Kusamura - Tamako Tamura\n*Hideko Hara - Masako Sugiyama\n*Hiroshi Miyasaka - Macho\n*Kunihiko Ida - Teiji Kaneko\n*Amie Toujou - Hisako Honda\n*Ayano Nakamura - Chikage Sugiyama\n*Katsunari Mineno - Keiri-kacho\n*Tomiko Ishii - Haruko Haraguchi\n*Masahiro Motoki - Hiromasa Kimoto\n\nRelease\n\nShall We Dance? was released on January 27, 1996 in Japan where it was distributed by Toho.

{"context": "\nCoronation Stakes\n|}\n\nThe Coronation Stakes is a Group 1 flat horse race in Great Britain open to three-year-old fillies. It is run at Ascot over a distance of 1 mile (1,609 metres), and it is scheduled to take place each year in June.\n\nHistory\n\nThe event was established in 1840, and its title commemorates the coronation of a new British monarch, Queen Victoria, two years earlier.\n\nThe present system of race grading was introduced in 1971, and for a period the Coronation Stakes held Group 2 status. It was promoted to Group 1 level in 1988.\n\nThe Coronation Stakes is now contested on the fourth day of the five-day Royal Ascot meeting. It usually features fillies which ran previously in the 1,000 Guineas, the Poule d'Essai des Pouliches or the Irish 1,000 Guineas.

He became their choreographer in 1971 and has since choreographed over 500 television shows.\n\nCareer\n\nEarly in Lythgoe's career, he learned to use techniques (e.g. multi-cameras) to film choreography well, a skill that would lead to a TV career.Looseleaf, p. 43  During the 1970s and into the 1980s, Lythgoe had the opportunity to perform with dancers from Cyd Charisse to Gene Kelly. He also choreographed for Ben Vereen, Shirley Bassey and (most famously) the Muppets.  Lythgoe, in an interview with People said that he was \"the only person to dance, choreograph, produce and direct the Royal Variety Performance.\" \n\nAfter working his way through the television industry, including at TVS, by 1995, Lythgoe held the post of Head of Entertainment and Comedy at London Weekend Television, where he commissioned and produced shows including Gladiators and Blind Date.http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?qcache:g7heFbC5lbcJ:everything2.com/index.pl%3Fnode_id%3D977386+Bonnie+Lythgoe&hl\nen&ctclnk&cd\n27&client=safari\n\nIn 2000, he became the tough judge on Popstars and was nicknamed \"Nasty Nigel\" by the British tabloid press.

{"context": "\nMatthew Webb\nCaptain Matthew Webb (19 January 1848 \u2013 24 July 1883) was the first recorded person to swim the English Channel without the use of artificial aids for sport purpose. On 25 August 1875, Webb swam from Dover to Calais in fewer than 22 hours.\n\nEarly life and career\n\nWebb was born at Dawley in Shropshire, one of twelve children of a Coalbrookdale doctor. He acquired his ability to swim in the River Severn at Coalbrookdale. In 1860 at the age of twelve he joined the training ship HMS Conway for two years then entered the merchant navy and served a three-year apprenticeship with Rathbone Brothers of Liverpool.\n\nWhilst serving as second mate on the Cunard Line ship Russia, travelling from New York to Liverpool, he attempted to rescue a man overboard by diving into the sea in the mid-Atlantic. The man was never found, but Webb's daring won him an award of \u00a3100 and the Stanhope Medal, and made him a hero of the British press.\n\nIn the summer of 1863, while at home, he rescued his 12-year-old brother Thomas from drowning in the Severn near Ironbridge.\n\nEnglish Channel swimming record\n\nIn 1873, Webb was serving as captain of the steamship Emerald when he read an account of the failed attempt by J. B. Johnson to swim the English Channel. He became inspired to try himself, and left his job to begin training, first at Lambeth Baths, then in the cold waters of the Thames, the English Channel and Hollingworth Lake. \n\nOn 12 August 1875, he made his first cross-Channel swimming attempt, but strong winds and poor sea conditions forced him to abandon the swim. On 24 August, he began a second swim by diving in from the Admiralty Pier at Dover. Backed by three escort boats and smeared in porpoise oil, he set off into the ebb tide at a steady breaststroke. Despite stings from jellyfish and strong currents off Cap Gris Nez which prevented him from reaching the shore for five hours, finally, after 21 hours and 45 minutes, he landed near Calais\u2014the first successful cross-channel swim. His zig-zag course across the Channel was over 39 miles (64\u00a0km) long.\n\nLater life\n\nAfter his record swim, Captain Webb basked in national and international adulation, and followed a career as a professional swimmer. He licensed his name for merchandising such as commemorative pottery, and wrote a book called The Art of Swimming. A brand of matches was named after him. He participated in exhibition swimming matches and stunts such as floating in a tank of water for 128 hours.\n\nOn 27 April 1880, he married Madeline Kate Chaddock, and they had two children, Matthew and Helen.\n\nDeath\n\nHis final stunt was to be a dangerous swim through the Whirlpool Rapids on the Niagara River below Niagara Falls, a feat many observers considered suicidal. Although Webb failed in an attempt at raising interest in funding the event,  on 24 July 1883, he jumped into the river from a small boat located near the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge and began his swim. Accounts of the time indicate that in all likelihood Webb successfully survived the first part of the swim, but died in the section of the river located near the entrance to the whirlpool.  Webb was interred in Oakwood Cemetery, Niagara Falls, New York. \n\nLegacy\n\nIn 1909, Webb's elder brother Thomas unveiled a memorial in Dawley. On it reads the short inscription: \"Nothing great is easy.\" The memorial was taken away for repair after a lorry collided with it in February 2009. The landmark memorial was returned after full restoration and was hoisted back onto its plinth in High Street in October 2009. A road (Webb Crescent) and Captain Webb School, both in Dawley, are named after the swimmer. A memorial plaque with his portrait was also unveiled in the parish church at Coalbrookdale. Webb House of the Adams' Grammar School in Newport, Shropshire, is named after Webb.\n\nCultural references\n\nJohn Betjeman's poem \"A Shropshire Lad\" (1940) commemorates the death of Captain Webb, portraying his ghost swimming back along the canal to Dawley.  It was set to music by Jim Parker and has been the most requested song on the repertoire of John Kirkpatrick during his entire career. \n\nCaptain Webb's picture on boxes of Bryant and May matches is said have inspired the physical appearance of the Inspector Clouseau character portrayed originally in the Pink Panther films by Peter Sellers. \n\nHe was parodied in Horrible Histories (TV Series) in stupid deaths.\n", "context_len": 847, "questions": ["What did Matthew Webb become the first person to swim across, in 1875?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Alysian fields", "Elysian Fields", "Elysian Fields (disambiguation)", "The Elysian Fields", "Elysiane fields", "Elysian fields"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nThe Story of Tracy Beaker\nThe Story of Tracy Beaker is a British children's book first published in 1991, written by Jacqueline Wilson and illustrated by Nick Sharratt.\n\nBackground\n\nThe book is told from the point of view of Tracy Beaker, a very naughty ten-year-old girl. The reason Tracy is often unhappy and has problems with her behaviour is because she is lonely, frustrated and feels unloved. Tracy resides in a children's residential care home (nicknamed \"The Dumping Ground\") where she has been placed as a result of neglect. Her mother often left Tracy to stay by herself when Tracy was very young and does not appear to have an interest in her daughter's life. Tracy is unhappy because she has not had any contact with her mother for a long time. She has difficulty getting along with the staff and the other children at the care home, (especially a girl named Justine Littlewood). Another reason Tracy is frustrated and angry is because she was rejected by two couples who attempted to foster her.\n\nFrom an adult's point of view, Tracy has \"behavioural problems\" and she is always telling tales. Tracy's stories seem to provide a high level of comfort and security for her. For example, a recurring story that Tracy likes to tell is that her mother is a glamorous Hollywood movie star, and that she is coming to collect her someday. Tracy says that her mother is so busy being in films that she does not have time for Tracy. Among other things, Tracy's autobiography details her life so far, her being \"deprived and abused\" in the children's home (for example, she is deprived of Mars Bars and Smarties) and the types of revenge she would like to take upon her enemies. She is very imaginative and believes that her mum will come home one day. She often portrays a deep and complicated mind.\n\nIn 2002 the book was voted the winner of the Blue Peter People's Choice Award. Wilson has written three sequels to the book, The Dare Game, Starring Tracy Beaker, and Tracy Beaker's Thumping Heart (a Red Nose Day Special).\n\nAdaptations\n\nThe Story of Tracy Beaker\n\nA TV adaptation of the book was made by the BBC. There have so far been five series of the TV programme, which mainly airs on CBBC, starring Dani Harmer in the role of Tracy Beaker. Montanna Thompson plays Justine Littlewood, Tracy's worst enemy, and Nisha Nayar plays her social worker, Elaine 'the pain' Boyak. There are many characters in the TV adaptation that do not feature in the book itself. The TV adaptation has several series, and towards the end, some episodes do not feature Tracy. The TV programmes expand on the lives of the children's daily affairs, whereas the book ends with Cam fostering Tracy and her living happily ever after. In the TV programme, Tracy has disagreements with Cam and ends up back in the children's home but maintains a strong relationship with Cam. Cam gets married to Gary at the end of the series, and the last we see of Tracy is when she is talking to Justine on the steps of the children's home, after being told she will be adopted by them. Having heard this, Justine decides to give living with her dad another go.\n\nTracy Beaker Returns\n\nA new series of Tracy Beaker entitled Tracy Beaker Returns began on 8 January 2010. It had 13 episodes. A second series was also announced by the BBC. It began on 7 January 2011 and concluded on 25 March 2011. It also had 13 episodes. A third series started on 6 January 2012 and concluded on 23 March 2012. It had 13 episodes. Series 3 was the final series of Tracy Beaker Returns, as Dani Harmer left the series.\n\nThe Dumping Ground\n\nThe Dumping Ground is a spin-off to Tracy Beaker Returns, which started in January 2013. It has an extremely similar format to Tracy Beaker Returns, with the only difference being that Tracy no longer features in the series. The only character in The Dumping Ground who featured in the original novel is Mike, a care worker at the children's home, although his characterisation has changed a lot from the book \u2013 in the TV series he is shown to be an amazingly kind care worker who understands all the children, whereas in the novel not much is revealed about him, and he is only mentioned in passing a few times by Tracy. The only departed character shown in the series was Gus Carmichael (Noah Marullo) as he gets fostered by a lesbian couple\n\nTracy Beaker Gets Real\n\nIn 2006, Tracy Beaker Gets Real, a musical version of The Story of Tracy Beaker, toured up and down Britain in various theatres.\n", "context_len": 901, "questions": ["Who is the author of the children's book 'The Story of Tracy Beaker'?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Gene Vincent & the Blue Caps", "Blue-caps", "Eugene Craddock", "Say Mama", "Vincent Eugene Craddock", "Blue Caps", "Bluecaps", "Gene Vincent and the Bluecaps", "Blue caps", "Gene Vincent", "Gene Vincent & His Blue Caps", "Gene Vincent and the Blue Caps", "Blue-cap", "Vincent Craddock", "The Blue Caps"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nThe Edge of Heaven\n\"The Edge of Heaven\" is a song by British pop duo Wham!, released on Epic Records in 1986. It was written by George Michael, one half of the duo, and was promoted in advance as Wham!'s farewell single.\n\nHistory\n\nWith the known desire of George Michael to move into a more adult market, Wham! had announced in the spring of 1986 that Michael and his musical partner Andrew Ridgeley would go their separate ways after a farewell single, album and concert. The album was called \"The Final\" and the concert was held in front of 72,000 fans at London's Wembley Stadium on Saturday 28 June 1986. \n\nThe single, a five-minute tale of emotional and physical frustration within a relationship, was a slick and upbeat \u2014 albeit harder-edged than earlier works \u2014 pop tune which became the fourth and final No. 1 in the UK Singles Chart  (and the final US Top Ten hit, reaching #10) for the duo. Elton John, a friend of Michael and Ridgeley, played piano on the track.\n\nMichael has said the lyrics to the song were \"deliberately and overtly sexual, especially the first verse\".  The reason for this, he says, was he thought no one would care \"because no one listens to a Wham! lyric.  It had got to that stage.\" \n\nEpic released a double record set in the UK, with an updated version of Wham!'s early signature song \"Wham Rap! (Enjoy What You Do)\" on the flip of disc one, and two new songs - \"Battlestations\" and a cover of the Was (Not Was) song \"Where Did Your Heart Go?\" - on the flip of the second disc. \"Where Did Your Heart Go?\" was later given an equal billing and reached a lowly position in the UK Top 40 as a result.\n\nIn the United States, \"The Edge of Heaven\" was backed with a live version of \"Blue\" from Wham!'s tour of China. \"Where Did Your Heart Go?\" was released separately as the follow-up and the fourth and last single from Music from the Edge of Heaven (the shortened American version of The Final), and charted at #50 (backed with \"Wham! Rap '86\").\n\nTwo months earlier, George Michael had achieved his second solo No. 1 with \"A Different Corner\" (which also made #7 in the US), and he was back in the charts as a permanent solo artist within six months of \"The Edge of Heaven\".\n\nMusic video\n\nThe official music video for the song was directed by Andy Morahan. \n\nTrack listing\n\nChart positions\n", "context_len": 517, "questions": ["Who had a U.K. No 1 in the 80's with The Edge of Heaven"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Harrisburg (PA)", "Harrisburg, PA", "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania", "Memorial Middle School for Girls", "2011 Harrisburg Pennsylvania bankruptcy", "List of FM stations in Harrisburg", "Harrisburg High School (Pennsylvania)", "Harrisburg FM Stations", "Harrisburg, Pennsylvania metropolitan area", "Harrisburg, pa", "Harrisburg", "Harrisburg,Pennsylvania", "Harrisburg TV Stations", "List of newspapers in Harrisburg", "List of TV stations in Harrisburg", "UN/LOCODE:USHAR", "Harrisburg Newspapers", "Harrisburg, Pa.", "Harrisburg, Penna.", "Capital of Pennsylvania", "List of AM stations in Harrisburg"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

The film was based on J.\u00a0M. Barrie's 1902 stage comedy of the same name.\n\nPlot\n\nIn 1905 William Crichton (Kenneth More) is the efficient butler in the London household of the Earl of Loam (Cecil Parker) and his family. Crichton knows his place in the highly class-conscious English society. The Earl insists that all men are equal, and to prove it, he orders his daughters to treat the staff as guests during an uncomfortable afternoon tea. Lady Brocklehurst (Martita Hunt) arrives and strongly disapproves of the arrangement, as does Crichton.\n\nWhen Lady Catherine (Mercy Haystead), one of the Earl's daughters, is arrested at a suffragette protest, Crichton recommends the family take a trip on the Earl's steam yacht to the South Seas until the scandal dies down. When the yacht's motors explode during a storm, all are forced to abandon ship. By the time Crichton rescues the still sleeping \"tweeny\" maid Eliza (Diane Cilento), the lifeboats have already departed. They jump into the water and are picked up by the wrong boat, the one reserved for the upper class.\n\nCrichton, Eliza, the Earl, his daughters Mary (Sally Ann Howes), Catherine and Agatha (Miranda Connell), clergyman John Treherne (Jack Watling), and Lord Ernest Woolley (Gerald Harper) land on a deserted island. The aristocrats prove to be helpless in their strange new surroundings. It is up to Crichton to start a fire, provide shelter, and find food.\n\nWhen the abandoned yacht appears and drifts into an offshore rock formation, Crichton swims out to salvage what he can. Upon his return, however, the others order him to pick up unnecessary luxuries rather than vital supplies on his next trip. He reluctantly complies, but at dinner, he insists he must take charge. The Earl instead discharges him. Eliza throws in her lot with Crichton, and the two depart.\n\nThe Earl and his party soon realise that they cannot do without Crichton and capitulate, Mary being the sole holdout. She is eventually forced to give in as well.\n\nAfter two years, the social order has been completely upended: Crichton, now affectionately known as \"the Guv\", is in charge, while his former betters are his servants. In fact, the aristocrats have toughened up admirably and are quite content with their lot. Romantically, however, the situation is in disarray, as everyone waits to see whether Crichton will choose Mary or \"Tweeny\" (as Eliza is now called), both of whom are deeply in love with him. All three of the other men are smitten with Tweeny.\n\nFinally, Crichton chooses Mary. However, just as they are exchanging wedding vows, a ship is sighted. Mary begs the others not to light a signal fire, reminding them how happy they have been on the island, but in the end, Crichton does so. When a rescue party lands, he has put on his butler's uniform and resumed his servile duties, much to the discomfort of the others.\n\nThe castaways return to London. Woolley writes a book of their experiences, one that portrays him as the saviour of the group. Lady Brocklehurst, suspecting that the work is full of lies, insists on questioning all of the party privately. Crichton tells the truth, but in such a way as to conceal everything. After the Duchess leaves, he tenders his resignation. When the Earl offers financial assistance for his plan to start a business, Crichton shows him a bag of valuable pearls acquired while on the island. Mary begs him to return there with her, but Crichton tells her they cannot fight civilisation. In the end, Tweeny is ecstatic when he accepts her offer to go with him.\n\nCast\n\n* Kenneth More as Bill Crichton\n* Diane Cilento as Eliza, also known as \"Tweeny\"\n* Cecil Parker as Lord Henry Loam\n* Sally Ann Howes as Lady Mary\n* Martita Hunt as Lady Brocklehurst\n* Jack Watling as John Treherne\n* Peter Graves as George Brocklehurst\n* Gerald Harper as Ernest Woolley\n* Mercy Haystead as Lady Catherine\n* Miranda Connell as Lady Agatha\n* Miles Malleson as Vicar\n* Eddie Byrne as Captain\n* Joan Young as Mrs. Perkins\n* Brenda Hogan as Fisher\n* Peter Welch as Rolleston\n* Toke Townley as Lovegrove\n* Roland Curram as Thomas\n\nProduction\n\nThe movie was a co production between Alexander Korda's old company and Colubmia. \n\nLewis Gilbert said the film:\nWas freely adapted from the Barrie play to suit Kenny, and it was a very successful film. I don't think you owe total allegiance to the original text because you are, in a sense, making something that is very different. I was very fond of Kenny as an actor, although he wasn't particularly versatile. What he could do, he did very well. His strengths were his ability to portray charm; basically he was the officer returning from the war and he was superb in that kind of role. The minute that kind of role went out of existence, he began to go down as a box office star. \nThe film was shot from September to December 1956 in Bermuda and at London Film Studios in Shepperton, England. \n\nReception\n\nThe film was the third most popular film at the British box office in 1957. \n\nOther film adaptations\n\nOther film versions of Barrie's play include a 1918 film adaptation directed by G. B. Samuelson, Cecil B. DeMille's Male and Female (1919), and We're Not Dressing (1934) with Bing Crosby. The play was also filmed twice for television, in 1950 and 1968.\n", "context_len": 1114, "questions": ["Who starred in the title role of \u2018The Admirable Crichton\u2019 in a 1957 film?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["M.

He formerly played for Bath Rugby club. In 2009 after a positive drugs test, he was banned from the game for two years.\n\nEarly life\n\nStevens was educated at Kearsney College, South Africa and played his youth rugby in that country, earning representative honours for Western Province, South African Universities and the Junior Springboks at Under 18 and Under 19 level, before deciding to move to England to pursue his university studies. \n\nClub career\n\nHe joined Bath in September 2002  and gained attention towards the end of the 2002\u201303 season, making five appearances as a substitute. He put in strong performances coming off the bench for Bath early in the following season as the pack dominated all opposition.\n\nHe featured in Bath's successful drive to the top of the Z\u00fcrich Premiership table in 2003\u201304 and in March 2004 he was selected ahead of Jason Leonard as a replacement in England's Six Nations game against  at Twickenham.\n\nStevens was known for popping up in the back line during matches for Bath, and has quite a turn of pace for a front-rower.\n\nIn January 2008, Stevens signed a four-year contract with Bath that would have kept him at the club until the end of the 2011\u201312 season. \n\nHowever, on 20 January 2009 it was confirmed Stevens had failed a drug test after Bath's Heineken Cup match against Glasgow the previous month.

He soon drew the attention of the England senior team selectors and was selected for the 2004 summer tour to New Zealand and Australia. He won his first two caps as a substitute in the Tests against the All Blacks but a knee injury meant he was unavailable for the test against  in Brisbane.\n\nHe was in the England team for the 2005 Six Nations, and was one of the better performers in England's disappointing campaign. He was selected for the 2005 British and Irish Lions tour  and featured in six games, though he did not play in any of the Test matches.\n\nDuring the 2006 Six Nations Championship he suffered a shoulder injury that required two operations and kept him out of the game for nearly a year; he did not return to international duty until England's mid-year tour to South Africa in June 2007.\n\nStevens was in England's squad for the 2007 Rugby World Cup.

{"context": "\nPainted Desert (Arizona)\nThe Painted Desert is a United States desert of badlands in the Four Corners area (cited by Trimble The Sagebrush Ocean, p. 10) running from near the east end of the Grand Canyon National Park  southeast into the Petrified Forest National Park.  It is most easily accessed in the north portion of The Petrified Forest National Park.  The Painted Desert is known for its brilliant and varied colors, that not only include the more common red rock, but even shades of lavender. \n\nThe Painted Desert was named by an expedition under Francisco V\u00e1zquez de Coronado on his 1540 quest to find the Seven Cities of Cibola, which he located some forty miles east of The Petrified Forest National Park.  Finding the cities were not made of gold, Coronado sent an expedition to find the Colorado River to resupply him.  Passing through the wonderland of colors, they named the area \"El Desierto Pintado\" - The Painted Desert. \n\nMuch of the Painted Desert within the Petrified Forest National Park is protected as the Petrified Forest National Wilderness Area where motorized travel is limited.   But the park offers both easy and longer hikes into the colored hills.  The Painted Desert continues north into the Navajo Nation where off-road travel is by permit.\n\nGeology\n\nThe desert is composed of stratified layers of easily erodible siltstone, mudstone, and shale of the Triassic Chinle Formation. These fine grained rock layers contain abundant iron and manganese compounds which provide the pigments for the various colors of the region. Thin resistant lacustrine limestone layers and volcanic flows cap the mesas. Numerous layers of silicic volcanic ash occur in the Chinle and provide the silica for the petrified logs of the area. The erosion of these layers has resulted in the formation of the badlands topography of the region.   \n\nIn the southern portions of the desert the remains of a Triassic period coniferous forest have fossilized over millions of years. Wind, water and soil erosion continue to change the face of the landscape by shifting sediment and exposing layers of the Chinle Formation. An assortment of fossilized prehistoric plants and animals are found in the region, as well as dinosaur tracks and the evidence of early human habitation.\n\nArea and climate\n\nThe Painted Desert extends roughly from Cameron\u2013Tuba City southeast to past Holbrook and the Petrified Forest National Park. The desert is about 120 mi long by about 60 mi wide, making it roughly 7500 mi2 in area.  Bordering southwest and south is the Mogollon Plateau, and on the plateau's south border the Mogollon Rim, the north border of the Arizona transition zone.\n\nOwing to the strong rain shadow of the Mogollon Rim, the Painted Desert has a cold desert climate (K\u00f6ppen BWk), with hot, dry summers and cold, though virtually snow-free winters. The annual precipitation is the lowest in northern Arizona and in many places is lower even than Phoenix. \n\nAccessibility\n\nMuch of the region is accessible only by foot or unpaved road though major highways and paved roads cut across the area. The towns of Cameron and Tuba City, both on the Navajo Nation, are two major settlements. A permit is required for all backroad travel on the Navajo Nation. \n\nGallery\n\nImage:The Painted Desert.JPG|The Painted Desert, Petrified Forest National Park\nImage:Painted Desert 2 700px.jpg|The gray and red colored bands across the landform are typical of most geologic features in the Painted Desert.\nImage:Blue Mesa Painted Desert.jpg|Painted Desert with logs of petrified wood, Petrified Forest National Park\nFile:Another White Pocket Sunset.jpg|Sunset in White Pocket, Vermilion Cliffs National Monument\n", "context_len": 658, "questions": ["The Painted Desert is in which US state?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Edvard munch", "Edward munch", "Death In the Sickroom", "Edvvard Munch", "Frieze of Life", "Edvard Munch", "Edward Munch"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nDrey\nA drey \u2014 or dray \u2014 is a nest of a tree squirrel or a flying squirrel. Dreys are usually built of twigs, dry leaves, and grass, and typically assembled in the forks of a tall tree.  They are sometimes referred to as \u201cdrey nests\u201d to distinguish them from squirrel \u201ccavity nests\u201d (also termed \u201cdens\u201d). In temperate regions, dreys become much more visible in the autumn, when leaf-fall reveals new nests built the previous summer or in early fall.\n\nA favoured site for a drey is a tree crotch about 30 to above ground level. Squirrels may also nest in attics or exterior walls of buildings, where a drey may be regarded as a fire hazard, as some squirrels have a habit of gnawing on electrical cables. At other times, squirrels may inhabit a permanent tree den in the hollow of a trunk or large branch. \n\nEtymology\n\nThe origin of the word \u201cdrey\u201d means one where squirrel's nest, but has been traced in English to the early 17th century. \n\nConstruction\n\nIn North America, dreys begin as a collection of small, gnawed-off branches bearing green leaves. The habit of harvesting these branches well before autumn (when the leaves would naturally fall) allows the leaves \u2013 though they turn brown \u2013 to adhere tightly throughout the winter.   A finished drey is a hollow sphere, about a foot or more in diameter, with branches and other rough-hewn materials loosely woven on the outside and an inner surface lined with a variety of finer materials, such as grass, moss, leaves, shredded bark or pine needles. There may be one, or occasionally two, entrance/exit holes in a drey, usually close to the bottom and oriented toward the trunk, which keeps rain out. A second hole is used for an escape route. The incomplete or flat dreys sometimes seen may be hot-weather sleeping platforms, or abandoned efforts built by very young, inexperienced squirrels.\n\nDrey construction materials and sizes differ according to squirrel species and region. Eastern gray squirrels, for example, tend to use the leaves, bark and twigs of deciduous trees such as beech, elm, and oak. Southern flying squirrels will often employ fungal rhizomorphs, deciduous leaves, bark and twigs in their nests, while northern flying squirrels often use shredded cedar bark (among other types of bark), lichens, mosses, leaves and twigs in their dreys. In the Pacific Northwest, the northern flying squirrel employs the common Bryoria lichen as the primary material.   A drey is almost always at least 20 ft above the ground, and flying squirrels build much higher.\n\nSometimes squirrels build their own dreys and sometimes they occupy a vacant drey that was previously constructed by another tree squirrel, often of a different species. Dreys must protect against the environment, and require constant upkeep to remain water and predator-resistant. Squirrels often build more than one in a season, as reserve nests, lest the primary drey be disturbed by predators or overrun by fleas or lice. Some dreys have been observed in use for more than a decade by multiple generations of squirrels, although the average drey may be used only a year or two before being abandoned. If used repeatedly, squirrels must constantly maintain their drey, replenishing twigs and leaves as necessary. Remnants of an abandoned nest may be visible for years.\n\nOccupation\n\nMale and female squirrels may share the same nest for short times during a breeding season, and during cold winter spells squirrels may share a drey to stay warm. However, females nest alone when pregnant. In North America, squirrels produce broods of about three \u201cpups\" twice a year. (After leaving the drey, a young squirrel is termed a \u201cjuvenile\u201d for its first year of life.) The June broods are sometimes born in dreys, but January broods are usually born and raised in tree cavities, which are much safer. Drey broods are about 40% less likely to survive than tree cavity broods, so long as the cavity entrance hole is no wider than about four inches, which can keep out hungry raccoons.\n", "context_len": 775, "questions": ["What is a squirrel's nest called?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["MARTIN LUTHER KING", "The Reverend Doctor Martin Luther King, Junior", "Martin Luther King,Jr.", "MLK Jr.", "Luther king jr", "Rev.

{"context": "\nOrgan (anatomy)\nIn biology, an organ or viscus is a collection of tissues joined in a structural unit to serve a common function.  In anatomy, a viscus is an internal organ, and viscera is the plural form.   \n\nOrgans are composed of main tissue, parenchyma, and \"sporadic\" tissues, stroma. The main tissue is that which is unique for the specific organ, such as the myocardium, the main tissue of the heart, while sporadic tissues include the nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissues. Functionally related organs often cooperate to form whole organ systems. Organs exist in all higher biological organisms, in particular they are not restricted to animals, but can also be identified in plants. In single-cell organisms like bacteria, the functional analogue of an organ is called organelle. \n\nA hollow organ is a visceral organ that forms a hollow tube or pouch, such as the stomach or intestine, or that includes a cavity, like the heart or urinary bladder.\n\nOrgan systems \n\nTwo or more organs working together in the execution of a specific body function form an organ system, also called a biological system or body system. The functions of organ systems often share significant overlap. For instance, the nervous and endocrine system both operate via a shared organ, the hypothalamus. For this reason, the two systems are combined and studied as the neuroendocrine system. The same is true for the musculoskeletal system because of the relationship between the muscular and skeletal systems.\n\nMammals such as humans have a variety of organ systems. These specific systems are also widely studied in human anatomy.\n* Cardiovascular system: pumping and channeling blood to and from the body and lungs with heart, blood and blood vessels.\n* Digestive system: digestion and processing food with salivary glands, esophagus, stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, intestines, colon, rectum and anus.\n* Endocrine system: communication within the body using hormones made by endocrine glands such as the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, pineal body or pineal gland, thyroid, parathyroids and adrenals, i.e., adrenal glands.\n* Excretory system: kidneys, ureters, bladder and urethra involved in fluid balance, electrolyte balance and excretion of urine.\n* Lymphatic system: structures involved in the transfer of lymph between tissues and the blood stream, the lymph and the nodes and vessels that transport it including the Immune system: defending against disease-causing agents with leukocytes, tonsils, adenoids, thymus and spleen.\n* Integumentary system: skin, hair and nails.\n* Muscular system: movement with muscles.\n* Nervous system: collecting, transferring and processing information with brain, spinal cord and nerves.\n* Reproductive system: the sex organs, such as ovaries, fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina, mammary glands, testes, vas deferens, seminal vesicles, prostate and penis.\n* Respiratory system: the organs used for breathing, the pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, lungs and diaphragm.\n* Skeletal system: structural support and protection with bones, cartilage, ligaments and tendons.\n\nOther animals\n\nThe organ level of organisation in animals can be first detected in flatworms and the more advanced phyla. The less-advanced taxons (like Placozoa, Porifera and Radiata) do not show consolidation of their tissues into organs.\n\nPlants\n\nThe study of plant organs is referred to as plant morphology, rather than anatomy, as in animal systems. Organs of plants can be divided into vegetative and reproductive. Vegetative plant organs are roots, stems, and leaves. The reproductive organs are variable. In flowering plants, they are represented by the flower, seed and fruit. In conifers, the organ that bears the reproductive structures is called a cone. In other divisions (phyla) of plants, the reproductive organs are called strobili, in Lycopodiophyta, or simply gametophores in mosses.\n\nThe vegetative organs are essential for maintaining the life of a plant. While there can be 11 organ systems in animals, there are far fewer in plants, where some perform the vital functions, such as photosynthesis, while the reproductive organs are essential in reproduction. However, if there is asexual vegetative reproduction, the vegetative organs are those that create the new generation of plants (see clonal colony).\n\nHistory\n\nEtymology\n\nThe English word \"organ\" derives from the Latin ', meaning \"instrument\", itself from the Greek word , ' (\"implement; musical instrument; organ of the body\"). The Greek word is related to , ' (\"work\").Barnhart's Concise Dictionary of Etymology The viscera, when removed from a butchered animal, are known collectively as offal. Internal organs are also informally known as \"guts\" (which may also refer to the gastrointestinal tract), or more formally, \"innards\".\n\nAristotle used the word frequently in his philosophy, both to describe the organs of plants or animals (e.g. the roots of a tree, the heart or liver of an animal), and to describe more abstract \"parts\" of an interconnected whole (e.g. his philosophical works, taken as a whole, are referred to as the \"organon\").\n\nThe English word \"organism\" is a neologism coined in the 17th century, probably formed from the verb to organize. At first the word referred to an organization or social system. The meaning of a living animal or plant is first recorded in 1842. Plant organs are made from tissue built up from different types of tissue. When there are three or more organs it is called an organ system. \n\nThe adjective visceral, also splanchnic, is used for anything pertaining to the internal organs. Historically, viscera of animals were examined by Roman pagan priests like the haruspices or the augurs in order to divine the future by their shape, dimensions or other factors. This practice remains an important ritual in some remote, tribal societies.\n\nThe term \"visceral\" is contrasted with the term \"\", meaning \"of or relating to the wall of a body part, organ or cavity\". The two terms are often used in describing a membrane or piece of connective tissue, referring to the opposing sides.\n\n7 Vital Organs of Antiquity\n\nSome alchemists (e.g. Paracelsus) adopted the Hermetic Qabalah assignment between the 7 vital organs and the 7 Classical planets as follows:\n", "context_len": 1195, "questions": ["Which organ of the body produces bile"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Arlene Philips", "Arlene Phillips"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

These muscles form the outer shape of the shoulder and underarm. The muscles in the shoulder aid in a wide range of movement and help protect and maintain the main shoulder joint, known as the glenohumeral joint.\nThe largest of these shoulder muscles is the deltoid. This large triangular muscle covers the glenohumeral joint and gives the shoulder its rounded-off shape. It stretches across the top of the shoulder from the clavicle in the front to the scapula in the back. It then stretches downward to near the center of the humerus bone. Different fibers of the muscle are responsible for different actions, including raising the arm and assisting the pectoralis muscle in the chest. One important function of the deltoid is preventing joint dislocation when a person carries heavy objects.\nOther muscles that aid in shoulder movement include:\nInfraspinatus:      This rotator cuff muscle helps with the raising and lowering of the upper      arm.\nTriceps brachii:      This large muscle in the back of the upper arm helps straighten the arm.\nPectoralis major:      This large fan-shaped muscle stretches from the armpit up to the      collarbone and down across the lower chest region. It connects to the      sternum (breastbone).\nPectoralis minor:      The smaller of the pectoralis muscles, this muscle fans out from the upper      ribs up to the shoulder area.\nTeres major:      This muscle helps rotate the upper arm.\nBiceps brachii:      Commonly known as the bicep muscle, this muscle rests on top of the      humerus bone. It rotates the forearm and also flexes the elbow.\nLatissimus dorsi:      This flat rectangular muscle of the back helps the arms rotate as well as      move away and closer to the body.\nSubscapularis:      This is a large triangular muscle near the humerus and collarbone. It      helps rotate the humerus.\nSupraspinatus:      This small muscle is located at the top of the shoulder and helps raise      the arm away from the body.\nFour muscles\u2014the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor, and subscapularis\u2014make up the rotator cuff. It stabilizes the shoulder and holds the head of the humerus into the glenoid cavity to maintain the principal shoulder joint.\nBecause these muscles are used in a wide range of motion and are responsible for bearing heavy loads, shoulder muscle pain is a common ailment. The most common cause of shoulder pain is overexertion of a muscle or injury to it. Twisting, pulling, or falling are common ways muscles in the shoulders become painful. Repetitive use injuries primarily affect the deep muscles; however, pain and soreness as a result of pulled muscles from heavy lifting or overexertion usually subsides in a few days.\nMinor shoulder muscle pain can usually be healed with a combination of rest, ice, elevation, and compression of the impacted region.\nDebugging Tools\n", "context_len": 560, "questions": ["In the human body, what is the name for the muscle that covers the shoulder?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["A week is a long time in politics", "Sir Harold Wilson", "Shadow Cabinet of Harold Wilson", "Harold Wilson, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx", "James Harold Wilson", "First Shadow Cabinet of Harold Wilson", "Harold Wilson's", "Wilson, Harold", "James Harold Wilson, Baron Wilson of Rievaulx", "Harold Wilson", "HAROLD WILSON", "Baron Wilson of Rievaulx Wilson Harold", "Baron Wilson of Rievaulx", "Shadow Cabinet of Harold Wilson I"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

The circuit was designed by Hermann Tilke,   and is situated on Yas Island, about 30 minutes from the capital of the UAE, Abu Dhabi. Yas Marina is the second Formula One track in the Middle East, with the first being in Bahrain. A two-day GP2 Asia Series test was held to officially open the circuit, which was held a week before the 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.  It also hosted the opening event for the Australian V8 Supercars series, the Yas V8 400, in February 2010.   Outside motorsport the circuit was used for the final stage of the inaugural Abu Dhabi Tour cycle race in 2015. The circuit has FIA Grade 1 license. \n\nDesign \n\nThe twenty-one corners twist through Yas Island off the Abu Dhabi coast,  passing by the marina and through the Yas Viceroy Abu Dhabi Hotel designed and conceived by New York-based architects Hani Rashid and Lise Anne Couture of Asymptote Architecture, and winding its way through sand dunes, with several long straights and tight corners.\n\nThe marina-based development includes a theme park, a water park, as well as residential areas, hotels and beaches.\n\nThe circuit has five grandstand areas (Main Grandstand, West Grandstand, North Grandstand, South Grandstand and Marina Grandstand (aka Support)) and part of its pit lane exit runs underneath the track. It also houses a team building behind the pit building, Media Center, Dragster Track, VIP Tower and Ferrari World Theme Park.

Among the sub-contractors involved were KOH AH HING  from Malaysia (structural contractor), as well as specialised subcontractors like Voltas (MEP), PKE-Siemens (MEP), Able-Middle East (earthworks), Hamilton International (interior) and Bau Bickhardt (track) to name a few.\n\nThe circuit was constructed with a permanent lighting system provided by Musco Lighting, similar to that also installed at the Losail Circuit in Qatar. Yas Marina Circuit is the largest permanent sports venue lighting project in the world; previously that title was held by Losail.\n\nThe surface of the track is made of graywacke aggregate, shipped to Abu Dhabi from a Bayston Hill quarry in Shropshire, England.  The surface material is highly acclaimed by circuit bosses and Formula One drivers for the high level of grip it offers.  The same aggregate material is used at the Bahrain International Circuit for the Bahrain Grand Prix. \n\nOn 7 October 2009, the circuit was granted final approval to hold Formula One races by the FIA.  Bruno Senna was the first driver to complete a test run on the circuit.\n\nGP3 visited Abu Dhabi for the first time at the end of the 2013 season. \n\nReception\n\nAfter the first practice sessions at the 2009 Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, the circuit was welcomed by the drivers, with Nico Rosberg commenting that every corner was 'unique',  while double World Champion Fernando Alonso echoed his sentiments, stating that it was enjoyable because there was always something to do. Force India's Adrian Sutil rated the circuit as being better than Formula One's other night race in Singapore as he felt there was too much light at Marina Bay.\n\nNot all of the drivers were complimentary, with Giancarlo Fisichella expressing a particular dislike of the pit exit, which dips under the main circuit by way of a tunnel. Although the pit exit remained free of incidents for the early practice sessions, Fisichella claimed that it was both very difficult and dangerous. Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen also said unfavorable things about the track: \"The first few turns are quite good, but the rest of it is shit\". \n\nFile:YasMarina1.jpeg\nFile:YasMarina2.jpeg\n", "context_len": 742, "questions": ["In 2009, Yas Marina was the circuit for which country's first ever Formula One motor race?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["one thousand, nine hundred and forty-eight", "1948"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nCagayan River\nThe Cagayan River, also known as the Rio Grande de Cagayan, is the longest and largest river in the Philippine Archipelago.  It is located in the Cagayan Valley region in northeastern part of Luzon Island and traverses the provinces of Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Isabela and Cagayan.\n\nTopography\n\nThe river's headwaters are at the Caraballo Mountains of the Central Luzon at an elevation of approximately 1524 m. The river flows north for some 505 km  to its mouth at the Babuyan Channel near the town of Aparri, Cagayan. The river drops rapidly to 91 m above sea level some 227 km from the river mouth. Its principal tributaries are the Pinacanauan, Chico, Siffu, Mallig, Magat and Ilagan Rivers.\n\nMagat River is the largest tributary with an estimated annual discharge of 9,808 million cubic meters. It lies in the southwestern portion of the basin, stretching approximately 150 km from Nueva Vizcaya down to its confluence with Cagayan River about 55 km from the river mouth.\n\nBoth Magat and Chico Rivers have extensive drainage areas which comprise about 1/3 of the whole basin.\n\nThe Ilagan River originates from the western slopes of the Sierra Madre and drains the eastern central portion of the Cagayan River basin with an estimated yearly discharge of 9,455 million cubic meters. It flows westward and joins the Cagayan River at Ilagan, Isabela, 200 km from the mouth.\n\nThe Siffu-Mallig system lies on the slope of the Central Cordillera ranges flowing almost parallel to the Magat River. Marshes and swamps are found in some parts of its lower reaches.\n\nCagayan River and its tributaries have deposited sediments of Tertiary and Quaternary origin, mostly limestone sands and clays, throughout the relatively flat Cagayan Valley which is surrounded by the Cordillera Mountains in the west, Sierra Madre in the east and the Caraballo Mountains in the south.\n\nThe river has a drainage area of about 27300 km2. in the provinces of Apayao, Aurora, Cagayan, Ifugao, Isabela, Kalinga, Mountain Province, Nueva Vizcaya, and Quirino.\n\nThe estimated annual discharge is 53,943 million cubic meters  with a groundwater reserve of 47,895 million cubic meters.\n\nFlooding\n\nThe Cagayan River and its tributaries are subject to extensive flooding during the monsoon season in Southeast Asia from May to October.\n\nThe average annual rainfall in 1000 mm in the northern part and 3000 mm in the southern mountains where the river's headwaters lie. Water from the mountains flow down very slowly because of surface retention over the extensive flood plain, the gorges in the gently-sloping mountains and the meandering course of the river.\n\nThe inundation of the Cagayan River and its tributaries have caused great loss of life and property and substantial losses to the local and national economies. The Philippine government has established several flood warning stations along the river. Experts are specifically monitoring the lower reaches from Tuguegarao to Aparri and the alluvial plain from Ilagan to Tumauini, Isabela.\n\nFlora and fauna\n\nThe Cagayan River passes through one of the few remaining primary forests in the Philippines.\n\nIt supports the lives of numerous endemic and endangered species, like the Luzon bleeding-heart pigeon (Gallicolumba luzonica), Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi) and a rare riverine fish, locally called ludong (Cestreaus plicatilis).\n\nThe ludong spawns in Cagayan River's upper reaches in Jones, Isabela. In late October until mid-November, the fish travel down the river to release their eggs at the river mouth near Aparri.\n\nIn February, ludong fry by the millions are again caught in fine nets as these travel upstream.\n\nDue to the dwindling number of ludong caught yearly, local governments have imposed a ban on catching the fish and its fry, but the ban has failed.\n\nPeople\n\nThe river traverses four provinces: Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Isabela and Cagayan. These provinces have an approximate population of two million people, mostly farmers and indigenous tribesmen.\n\nThe Ibanag people derive their tribe's name from Cagayan River's ancient name, Bannag. The Gaddang tribe lived in the upper riches of the Cagayan River and its tributaries.\n\nEconomic importance\n\nThe river drains a fertile valley that produces a variety of crops, including rice, corn, bananas, coconut, citrus and tobacco.\n\nThere are dams in two of the river's tributaries, the Magat and Chico Rivers, and there are also several mining concessions in the mineral-rich Cordillera Mountains near the headwaters of the two tributary rivers.\n\nThe provincial governments along the river have also developed tourism programs that offer activities on the river, particularly whitewater rafting.\n", "context_len": 835, "questions": ["The Cagayan River is the largest river in which country?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Tony (Manero).", "Tony Manero"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nMens sana in corpore sano\nMens sana in corpore sano is a Latin phrase, usually translated as \"a sound mind in a sound body\" or \"a healthy mind in a healthy body\".\n\nIn the western world, the phrase is widely used in sporting and educational contexts to express the theory that physical exercise is an important or essential part of mental and psychological well-being.\n\nHistory\n\nThe phrase comes from Satire X of the Roman poet Juvenal (10.356).  It is the first in a list of what is desirable in life:\n\nTraditional commentators believe that Juvenal's intention was to teach his fellow Roman citizens that in the main, their prayers for such things as long life are misguided. That the gods had provided man with virtues which he then lists for them.\n\nOver time and separated from its context, the phrase has come to have a range of meanings.  It can be construed to mean that only a healthy mind can lead to a healthy body, or equally that only a healthy body can produce or sustain a healthy mind.  Its most general usage is to express the hierarchy of needs: with physical and mental health at the root.\n\nAn earlier, similar saying is attributed to the pre-Socratic philosopher Thales:\n\n\u03c4\u03af\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f50\u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03bc\u03c9\u03bd, \"\u1f41 \u03c4\u1f78 \u03bc\u1f72\u03bd \u03c3\u1ff6\u03bc\u03b1 \u1f51\u03b3\u03b9\u03ae\u03c2, \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c8\u03c5\u03c7\u1f74\u03bd \u03b5\u1f54\u03c0\u03bf\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2, \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b9\u03bd \u03b5\u1f50\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2\"\nWhat man is happy? \"He who has a healthy body, a resourceful mind and a docile nature.\" \n\nUsages\n\n* Usage in other writings\n** John Locke (1632\u20131704) uses the phrase in his book Some Thoughts Concerning Education.\n** Heinrich von Treitschke used this phrase in his work titled The Army.

{"context": "\nElectrum\nElectrum is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver, with trace amounts of copper and other metals. It has also been produced artificially, and is often known as green gold. The ancient Greeks called it 'gold' or 'white gold', as opposed to 'refined gold'. Its colour ranges from pale to bright yellow, depending on the proportions of gold and silver.\n\nThe gold content of naturally occurring electrum in modern Western Anatolia ranges from 70% to 90%, in contrast to the 45\u201355% of gold in electrum used in ancient Lydian coinage of the same geographical area. This suggests that one reason for the invention of coinage in that area was to increase the profits from seigniorage by issuing currency with a lower gold content than the commonly circulating metal.\n\nElectrum was used as early as the third millennium BC in Old Kingdom Egypt, sometimes as an exterior coating to the pyramidions atop ancient Egyptian pyramids and obelisks.  Electrum was also used in the making of ancient drinking vessels.  The first metal coins ever made were of electrum and date back to the end of the 7th century or the beginning of the 6th century BC.  For several decades the medals awarded with the Nobel Prize have been made of gold-plated green gold.\n\nThe name electrum was also used to denote German \u2018silver\u2019, mainly for its use in making technical instruments. \n\nEtymology\n\nThe name \"electrum\" is the Latinized form of the Greek word \u1f24\u03bb\u03b5\u03ba\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd (\u00e8lektron), mentioned in the Odyssey referring to a metallic substance consisting of gold alloyed with silver. The same word was also used for the substance amber, likely because of the pale yellow colour of certain varieties, and it is from amber's electrostatic properties that the modern English words \"electron\" and \"electricity\" are derived. Electrum was often referred to as \"white gold\" in ancient times, but could be more accurately described as \"pale gold\", as it is usually pale yellow or yellowish-white in colour. The modern use of the term white gold usually concerns gold alloyed with any one or a combination of nickel, silver, platinum and palladium to produce a silver-coloured gold.\n\nComposition\n\nElectrum consists primarily of gold and silver but is sometimes found with traces of platinum, copper, and other metals.  The name is mostly applied informally to compositions between about 20-80% gold and 20-80% silver atoms, but these are strictly called gold or silver depending on the dominant element. Analysis of the composition of electrum in ancient Greek coinage dating from about 600 BC shows that the gold content was about 55.5% in the coinage issued by Phocaea. In the early classical period, the gold content of electrum ranged from 46% in Phokaia to 43% in Mytilene. In later coinage from these areas, dating to 326 BC, the gold content averaged 40% to 41%. In the Hellenistic period, electrum coins with a regularly decreasing proportion of gold were issued by the Carthaginians. In the later Eastern Roman Empire controlled from Constantinople, the purity of the gold coinage was reduced, and an alloy that can be called electrum began to be used.\n\nHistory\n\nElectrum is mentioned in an account of an expedition sent by Pharaoh Sahure of the Fifth dynasty of Egypt (see Sahure). It is also discussed by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia.\n\nElectrum is possibly referred to three times in the Bible (i.e. if the Septuagint's translation of the uncertain term \u05d7\u05b7\u05e9\u05b0\u05c1\u05de\u05b7\u05dc is accurate).  In all three instances it is used to describe a type of glow seen in visions by the prophet Ezekiel (Ezekiel Ch.1 Vs.4 and 27;Ch. 8 Vs. 2).\n\nElectrum is believed to have been used in coins circa 600 BC in Lydia under the reign of Alyattes II.\n\nElectrum was much better for coinage than gold, mostly because it was harder and more durable, but also because techniques for refining gold were not widespread at the time.  The discrepancy between gold content of electrum from modern Western Anatolia (70\u201390%) and ancient Lydian coinage (45\u201355%) suggests that the Lydians had already solved the refining technology for silver and were adding refined silver to the local native electrum some decades before introducing the pure silver coins cited below.\n\nIn Lydia, electrum was minted into 4.7-gram coins, each valued at 1/3 stater (meaning \"standard\"). Three of these coins (with a weight of about 14.1\u00a0grams, almost half an ounce) totaled one stater, about one month's pay for a soldier. To complement the stater, fractions were made: the trite (third), the hekte (sixth), and so forth, including 1/24 of a stater, and even down to 1/48th and 1/96th of a stater. The 1/96 stater was only about 0.14 to 0.15\u00a0grams. Larger denominations, such as a one stater coin, were minted as well.\n\nBecause of variation in the composition of electrum, it was difficult to determine the exact worth of each coin. Widespread trading was hampered by this problem, as cautious foreign merchants offered poor rates on local electrum coin..\n\nThese difficulties were eliminated in 570 BC when pure silver coins were introduced. However, electrum currency remained common until approximately 350 BC. The simplest reason for this was that, because of the gold content, one 14.1\u00a0gram stater was worth as much as ten 14.1\u00a0gram silver pieces.\n", "context_len": 1014, "questions": ["Electrum is a naturally occurring alloy of gold and which other metal?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Hattie jakes", "Hattie Jacques", "Josephine Edwina Jaques"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nWilliam Foulke (footballer)\nWilliam Henry \"Fatty\" Foulke (12 April 1874 \u2013 1 May 1916; sometimes spelled Foulk, Foulkes) was a professional cricketer and football player in England in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Foulke was renowned for his great size (  by some estimates) and weight, reaching perhaps 24 stone (152\u00a0kg; 336\u00a0lb) at the end of his career, although reports on his weight vary.\n\nPlaying career\n\nHe played four first-class matches for Derbyshire County Cricket Club in the 1900 season, but is remembered primarily as a goalkeeper for Sheffield United although he later played for Chelsea and Bradford City.\n\nAfter being discovered playing for village side Blackwell in a Derbyshire Cup tie at Ilkeston Town, Foulke made his debut for Sheffield United against West Bromwich Albion on 1 September 1894 and led the team to three FA Cup finals (winning two) and a League Championship.\n\nAccording to The Cat's Pyjamas: The Penguin Book of Cliches (ISBN 9780141025162), the \"Who ate all the pies?\" chant was first sung in 1894 by Sheffield United supporters, and directed at\nFoulke 300 lb. \n\nHe also won a single international cap for England in 1897 against Wales.\n\nAt the end of the first match in the 1902 Cup Final Foulke protested to the officials that Southampton's equalising goal should not have been allowed. Foulke left his dressing room unclothed and pursued the referee, Tom Kirkham, who took refuge in a broom cupboard. Foulke had to be stopped by a group of F.A. officials from wrenching the cupboard door from its hinges to reach the hapless referee.   In the replay, Sheffield United won 2\u20131, with Foulke being required to make several saves to keep United in the match. He was also in goal for United when they suffered an FA Cup exit to Second Division Burslem Port Vale in 1898.\n\nHe then moved to Chelsea for a fee of  \u00a350 and was made club captain. Foulke by now was remarkably temperamental. If he thought his defenders were not trying hard enough, he would walk off the field. Opposing forwards who incurred his displeasure would be picked up and thrown bodily into his goal. He was, however, a great crowd puller, and Chelsea decided to exploit this. To draw even more attention to his size, they placed two small boys behind his goal in an effort to distract the opposition even more. The boys would sometimes run and return the ball when it went out of play, and quite by accident, ball boys came into being.  Foulke stayed for just one season before moving to his final club, Bradford City.\n\nFoulke died in 1916 and was buried in Burngreave cemetery, Sheffield. His death certificate gives \"cirrhosis\" as the major cause of death.  Some modern sources contend that, beset by poverty, he was reduced to earning a pittance in a \"beat the goalie\" sideshow attraction in Blackpool where he caught pneumonia, from which he died.  These stories are not supported by contemporary accounts and seem to be apocryphal.\n\nFoulke appears in the Mitchell and Kenyon films, playing in a match on 6 September 1902.\n\nCareer stats\n\nHonours\n\n;;Sheffield United\n\n* First Division: 1898; Runner-up: 1897 and 1900\n* FA Cup: 1899, 1902; Finalist: 1901\n", "context_len": 623, "questions": ["William Foulke, Sheffield United's goalkeeper at the start of the 20th century, is reputed to be the first player to have what chanted at him?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["The Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet", "Juliet and Romeo (opera)", "The Most Excellent and Lamentable Tragedy of Romeo and Juliet", "Romeo and Juliet", "Romeo and Iuliet", "Romeo and juilet", "The most excellent and lamentable tragedie, of Romeo and Iuliet", "A plague on both your houses", "ROMEO AND JULIET", "Escalus", "Romeo And Juliet", "Romeo & juliet act 5", "The Tragedy Of Romeo And Juliet", "Romeo and Julia", "Romeo & Juliette", "Romeo and Juilet", "The Tragedy of Romeo & Juliet", "Romeo Juliet", "Romeo and Juliet Conflicts", "Romeo and Julet", "Romeo and juliet", "Romio and Julliet", "Romeo and Juliet (play)", "The Tragedy Romeo and Juliet", "Romeo & Juliet", "Montague and Capulet", "Romeo and Juiliet", "Romeo and Juliette"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nAll the world's a stage\n\"All the world's a stage\" is the phrase that begins a monologue from William Shakespeare's As You Like It, spoken by the melancholy Jaques in Act II Scene VII. The speech compares the world to a stage and life to a play, and catalogues the seven stages of a man's life, sometimes referred to as the seven ages of man:  infant, schoolboy, lover, soldier, justice, Pantalone and old age, facing imminent death. It is one of Shakespeare's most frequently quoted passages.\n \n\nOrigins\n\nWorld as a stage\n\nThe comparison of the world to a stage and people long predated Shakespeare. Richard Edwardes's play Damon and Pythias, written in the year Shakespeare was born, contains the lines, \"Pythagoras said that this world was like a stage / Whereon many play their parts; the lookers-on, the sage\".  When it was founded in 1599 Shakespeare's own theatre, The Globe, may have used the motto Totus mundus agit histrionem (All the world plays the actor), the Latin text of which is derived from a 12th-century treatise.  Ultimately the words derive from quod fere totus mundus exerceat histrionem (because almost the whole world are actors) attributed to Petronius, a phrase which had wide circulation in England at the time.\n\nIn his own earlier work, The Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare also had one of his main characters, Antonio, comparing the world to a stage:\n\nIn his work The Praise of Folly, first printed in 1511, Renaissance humanist Erasmus asks, \"For what else is the life of man but a kind of play in which men in various costumes perform until the director motions them off the stage.\" \n\nAges of man\n\nLikewise the division of human life into a series of ages was a commonplace of art and literature, which Shakespeare would have expected his audiences to recognize. The number of ages varied: three and four being the most common among ancient writers such as Aristotle. The concept of seven ages derives from medieval philosophy, which constructed groups of seven, as in the seven deadly sins, for theological reasons. The seven ages model dates from the 12th century.  King Henry V had a tapestry illustrating the seven ages of man. \n\nAccording to T. W. Baldwin, Shakespeare's version of the concept of the ages man is based primarily upon Palingenius' book Zodiacus Vitae, a school text he would have studied at the Stratford Grammar School, which also enumerates stages of human life. He also takes elements from Ovid and other sources known to him. \n\nIn addition, the second schoolboy stage is thought to originate when Shakespeare watched boys from St Olave's Grammar School (currently in Orpington, Greater London) walk to school in fear of the cane.\n", "context_len": 527, "questions": ["\"\"\"All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players,\"\" is from which Shakespeare play?\""], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["four", "4"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nBirthstone\nA birthstone is a gemstone that represents a person's month of birth. Birth stones are and can be worn as jewellery and pendants.\n\nHistory of birthstones\n\nWestern custom\n\nThe first century Jewish historian Josephus believed there was a connection between the twelve stones in Aaron's breastplate, the twelve months of the year, and the twelve signs of the zodiac.  Translations and interpretations of the passage in Exodus regarding the breastplate have varied widely, however, with Josephus himself giving two different lists for the twelve stones  (Kunz argues that Josephus saw the breastplate of the Second Temple, not the one described in Exodus).  St. Jerome, referencing Josephus, said the Foundation Stones of the New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:19\u201320) would be appropriate for Christians to use.  In the eighth and ninth century, religious treaties associating a particular stone with an apostle were written because the book of Revelation stated \"their name would be inscribed on the Foundation Stones, and his virtue\".  Practice became to keep twelve stones and wear one a month.  Wearing a single birthstone is only a few centuries old, although modern authorities differ on dates Kunz places the custom in eighteenth century Poland, while the Gemological Institute of America starts it in Germany in the 1560s. \n\nModern lists of birthstones have little to do with either the breastplate or the Foundation Stones of Christianity. Tastes, customs and confusing translations have distanced them from their historical origins,  with one author calling the 1912 Kansas list \"nothing but a piece of unfounded salesmanship.\" \n\nTraditional birthstones\n\nAncient traditional birthstones are society-based birthstones. The table below contains many stones which are popular choices, often reflecting Polish tradition. \n\nThe Gregorian calendar has poems matching each month with its birthstone. These are traditional stones of English-speaking societies. Tiffany & Co. published these poems \"of unknown author\" for the first time in a pamphlet in 1870. \n\nModern birthstones\n\nIn 1912, in an effort to standardize birthstones, the (American) National Association of Jewelers (now called Jewelers of America) met in Kansas and officially adopted a list.  The Jewelry Industry Council of America updated the list in 1952  by adding alexandrite to June and citrine to November; specifying pink tourmaline for October; replacing December's lapis with zircon; and switching the primary/alternative gems in March. The American Gem Trade Association added tanzanite as a December birthstone in 2002.  In 2016, the American Gem Trade Association and Jewelers of America added spinel as an additional birthstone for August.   Britain's National Association of Goldsmiths created their own standardized list of birthstones in 1937. \n\nEastern custom\n\nA Hindu text from 1879, Mani Mala, lists gems for each month. \n\nBirthstones by cultures\n\nZodiacal\n\nTropical zodiac\n\nBirthday (day of the week) stones\n\nWhile this word has also been used as synonym of Birth stone (see above), there is a separate list of assignment according to the day of the week of the recipient's birth: \n* Sunday: topaz, diamond\n* Monday: pearl, crystal\n* Tuesday: ruby, emerald\n* Wednesday: amethyst, lodestone\n* Thursday: sapphire, carnelian\n* Friday: emerald, cat's eye\n* Saturday: turquoise, diamond\n", "context_len": 592, "questions": ["What is the birthstone for the month of May?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Float like a butter fly sting like a bee", "Louisville lip", "Ali shuffle", "Float like a butterfly and sting like a bee", "Cassius Marcellus Clay Junior", "Muhummad Ali", "Maryum Ali", "Cassius X", "Cassius Marcellus Clay, Junior", "Louisville Lip", "Muhammad Ali", "Muhammud Ali", "Khalilah 'Belinda' Ali", "Cassius Clay Junior", "Float like a butterfly sting like a bee", "Muhammad Ali (boxer)", "Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr.", "Sonji Roi", "Ale Muhammad", "Cassius Marcellus Clay, Jr", "Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr.", "Cassius Marcellus Clay (Muhammad Ali)", "Cassius Clay, Junior", "Mohammed Al\u00ec", "Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr", "Muhamad Ali", "Yolanda Williams", "I am the greatest!", "Ali, Muhammad", "Cassius Clay", "Muhammet ali", "Yolanda 'Lonnie' Ali", "I am the greatest", "Cassius Clay, Jr.", "Muhammed Ali", "Cassius Clay Jr", "Cassius clay", "Lonnie Ali", "Cassius Clay, Jr", "May May"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

David D'Arcy reports for Morning Edition that even now, what the artist's sculptures actually express is a matter of debate.\nMost art critics assumed that those thin figures were rising from the ashes of Europe after the Holocaust, embodiments of a worldview that came to be called existentialism.\nSpoon Woman, 1926-27\n\u00a0 Click to enlarge\nGiacometti himself often said they were his homage to the ancient Greek and Egyptian art he saw and sketched at the Louvre Museum in Paris. But many critics say it is the very ambiguity of the images that give them such power.\nGiacometti did not intend to become a sculptor when he began his art career in Paris. A few years before he died in 1966, he told a French television interviewer that he took up the form because it wasn't easy:\n\"I did not want to spend my whole life making sculpture. I started sculpting because it was the art that I understood the least about. I should have moved on to other things that suited me better, but I couldn't tolerate the fact that I wasn't suited for sculpture. So kept doing it, so I'd get it out of my system.\"\nIn a famous encounter, the head of the surrealist movement, Andre Breton,  asked Giacometti whether any artist cared what a human head looked like.

{"context": "\nIsland country\nAn island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24% ) of the 193 UN member states are island countries.\n\nPolitics\n\nThe percentage of island countries that are democratic is higher than that of continental countries. Historically they have been more prone to political stability than their continental counterparts.\n\nWar\n\nIsland countries have often been the basis of maritime conquest and historical rivalry between other countries. \nIsland countries are more susceptible to attack by large, continental countries due to their size and dependence on sea and air lines of communication. \nMany island countries are also vulnerable to predation by mercenaries and other foreign invaders, \nalthough their isolation also makes them a difficult target. Powerful countries, such as the United Kingdom may develop a navy for protection and promotion of their interests, sometimes known as a sea power.\n\nNatural resources\n\nMany island countries rely heavily on fish for their main supply of food. \nSome are turning to renewable energy\u2014such as wind power, hydropower, geothermal power and biodiesel from copra oil\u2014to combat the rise in oil prices. \n\nGeography\n\nSome island countries are more affected than other countries by climate change, which produces problems such as reduced land use, water scarcity and sometimes even resettlement issues. Some low-lying island countries are slowly being submerged by the rising water levels of the Pacific Ocean. \nClimate change also impacts island countries by causing natural disasters such as tropical cyclones, hurricanes, flash floods and drought.  In 2011, the Center for Climate Change Law (CCCL) held a conference attended by 272 registrants from 39 island nations titled Legal Issues for Threatened Island Nations. \n\nEconomics\n\nMany island countries rely heavily on imports and are greatly affected by changes in the global economy. \nThe economies of island countries are usually smaller and more vulnerable to shipping costs, environmental damage to infrastructure, and isolation from other economies than those of larger, continental countries; exceptions include Japan, Australia and the United Kingdom.   \nThe dominant industry for many island countries is tourism. \n\nComposition\n\nIsland countries are typically small with low populations, although some, like Indonesia and Japan are notable exceptions. \n\nSome island countries are centred on one or two major islands, such as the United Kingdom, Trinidad and Tobago, New Zealand, Cuba, Bahrain, Abu Dhabi, Singapore and Taiwan. Others are spread out over hundreds or thousands of smaller islands, such as Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, Seychelles, and the Maldives. Some island countries share one or more of their islands with other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Ireland; Haiti and the Dominican Republic; and Indonesia, which shares islands with Papua New Guinea, Brunei, East Timor, and Malaysia. Malaysia and Singapore is another example of this and the latter was part of the former up until 1965.\n\nGeographically, the country of Australia is considered a continental landmass rather than an island, covering the largest landmass of the Australian continent. In the past, however, it was considered an island country for tourism purposes  (among others) and is still often referred to as such.\n", "context_len": 589, "questions": ["What island nation was hit by an earthquake and tsunami disaster in October 2010?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Route 66 (public transport)", "Route 66", "Route 66 (disambiguation)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nFlag of Ghana\nThe flag of Ghana was designed and adopted in 1957 and was flown until 1962, and then reinstated in 1966. It consists of the Pan-African colours of red, yellow, and green, in horizontal stripes, with a black five-pointed star in the centre of the gold stripe. The Ghanaian flag was the second African flag after the flag of Ethiopia to feature these colours.\n\nThe black star was adopted from the flag of the Black Star Line, a shipping line incorporated by Marcus Garvey that operated from 1919 to 1922,  and gives the Ghana national football team their nickname, the Black Stars.\n\nThe flag was designed by Theodosia Okoh. The red represents the blood of those who died in the country's struggle for independence from the United Kingdom, the gold represents the mineral wealth of the country, the green symbolises the country's rich forests and natural wealth, and the black star is the symbol of African emancipation. \n\nThe flag's design influenced that of the flag of Guinea-Bissau (1973).\n\nNational ensign\n\nUnder terms of section 183 of Ghana's Merchant Shipping Act of 1963, the civil ensign is a red flag with the national flag in a black-fimbriated canton. In 2003, a new merchant shipping act was enacted, however, and this simply provides that \"the National Flag of Ghana\" is the proper national colours for Ghanaian ships.  No mention is made of other flags or other possible flags.\n\nThe naval ensign is a red St. George cross on white flag, with the national flag in  canton.\n\nAir force ensign and civil air ensign\n\nThe Ghana Air Force has its own ensign which incorporates the flag of Ghana. Civil aviation in Ghana is represented by the national civil air ensign. It is a standard light blue field with the Ghanaian flag in the canton. It is charged in the fly with either a red, yellow and green roundel (in the case of the military ensign) or black five-pointed star (in the case of the civil ensign). they have both been used since independence, and the subsequent founding of the Ghana Air Force in 1959.\n\nHistory\n\nThe Ghanaian government flag, adopted in 1957, was flown until 1962. Similarly, when the country formed the Union of African States, the flag of the Union was modelled on Bolivia's flag, but with two black stars, representing the nations. In May 1959, a third star was added. Nowhere specified how the stars were arranged, and it was possible that they were arranged in a triangle, although the three-in-a-line formation (as shown here) is more likely.[http://www.allstates-flag.com/fotw/flags/qw-uas.html Union of African States at Flags of the World]\n\nIn 1962, prior to the dissolution of the Union the following year, Ghana adopted a variant of the 1957 tricolour with white in the place of yellow, after the colours of Kwame Nkrumah's ruling Convention People's Party, and similar to the flag of Hungary. The original 1957 flag was reinstated in 1966 following Nkrumah's overthrow in a coup d'\u00e9tat.\n", "context_len": 573, "questions": ["What is featured on the central yellow stripe of the flag of Ghana?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["My Fair Lady (2010 film)", "Enry Iggins", "Why Can't the English%3F", "My Fair Lady", "My Fair Lady (upcoming film)", "My Fair Lady (musical)", "My fair lady", "I'm an Ordinary Man", "My Fair Lady (2014 film)", "My Fair Lady (2012 film)", "My Fair Lady (2015 film)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

World Diabetes Day is a campaign that features a new theme chosen by the International Diabetes Federation each year to address issues facing the global diabetes community. While the campaigns last the whole year, the day itself marks the birthday of Frederick Banting who, along with Charles Best and John James Rickard Macleod, first conceived the idea which led to the discovery of insulin in 1922. \n\nEach year, World Diabetes Day is centred on a theme related to diabetes. Topics covered have included diabetes and human rights, diabetes and lifestyle, diabetes and obesity, diabetes in the disadvantaged and the vulnerable,  diabetes in children and adolescents. People with diabetes get to take a day off work or school on this day  and talking about Diabetes. \n\nWorld Diabetes Day is celebrated worldwide by the over 230 member associations of the International Diabetes Federation in more than 160 countries and territories, all Member States of the United Nations, as well as by other associations and organizations, companies, healthcare professionals and people living with diabetes and their families.\n\nThe global diabetes community including International Diabetes Federation member associations, diabetes organizations, NGOs, health departments, civil society, individuals and companies develop an extensive range of activities, tailored to a variety of groups.

{"context": "\nSo, we'll go no more a roving\n\"So, we'll go no more a roving\" is a poem, written by (George Gordon) Lord Byron (1788\u20131824), and included in a letter to Thomas Moore on 28 February 1817.  Moore published the poem in 1830 as part of Letters and Journals of Lord Byron.\n\nIt evocatively describes the fatigue of age conquering the restlessness of youth. Byron wrote the poem at the age of twenty-nine.\n\nIn the letter to Thomas Moore, the poem is preceded by an account of its genesis. \"At present, I am on the invalid regimen myself. The Carnival--that is, the latter part of it, and sitting up late o' nights--had knocked me up a little. But it is over--and it is now Lent, with all its abstinence and sacred music... Though I did not dissipate much upon the whole, yet I find 'the sword wearing out the scabbard,' though I have but just turned the corner of twenty nine.\" \n\nThe poem seems to have been suggested in part by the refrain of a Scottish song known as \"The Jolly Beggar.\" The Jolly Beggar was published in Herd's \"Scots Songs\" in 1776, 41 years before Byron's letter, and goes partially thus:\n\nHe took the lassie in his arms, and to bed he ran,\nO hooly, hooly wi' me, Sir, ye'll waken our goodman!\nAnd we'll go no more a roving\nSae late into the night,\nAnd we'll gang nae mair a roving, boys,\nLet the moon shine ne'er sae bright.\nAnd we'll gang nae mair a roving.\n\nThere is also the traditional sea shanty \"The Maid of Amsterdam,\" which includes verses and chorus such as: \n\nShe placed her hand upon my knee,\nMark well what I do say!\nShe placed her hand upon my knee,\nI said \"Young miss, you're rather free.\"\nI'll go no more a roving with you fair maid!\n\nA rovin', a rovin',\nSince rovin's been my ru-i-in, \nI'll go no more a roving \nWith you fair maid! \n\nHere is (George Gordon) Lord Byron's poem :\n\nSo, we'll go no more a-roving\nSo late into the night,\t \nThough the heart be still as loving,\nAnd the moon be still as bright.\t\n\nFor the sword outwears its sheath,\nAnd the soul wears out the breast,\nAnd the heart must pause to breathe,\nAnd love itself have rest.\n\nThough the night was made for loving,\t \nAnd the day returns too soon,\t  \nYet we'll go no more a-roving\t \nBy the light of the moon.\t \n \n\nThe poem appears as \"Go No More A-Roving\" on the 2004 Leonard Cohen album, Dear Heather. It has been recorded by Ariella Uliano on her 2009 album 'A.U. (almost) a Compilation'. It was also recorded by Joan Baez on her 1964 Joan Baez/5 album, and by Mike Westbrook on his 1998 The Orchestra of Smith's Academy album.  Richard Dyer-Bennet recorded his own setting, with slightly altered text, on the 1955 album \"Richard Dyer-Bennet 1\".  The poem is also a centerpiece of \"...And The Moon Be Still As Bright\" from Ray Bradbury's novel, The Martian Chronicles.\n\nThe poem also serves as a basis for the chorus of the song \"The Jolly Beggar\" as recorded by the traditional Irish band Planxty, as well as the basis for the love leitmotif in Patrick Doyle's score for the film Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where it is fully realized in the track, \"The Wedding Night\".\n\nMartin Best wrote a setting of it for the Royal Shakespeare Company's touring recital \"Pleasure and Repentance\" (devised by Terry Hands and the company)) in the 1970s.\n\nThe poem is also featured in John Wyndham's seminal post-holocaust book, The Day of the Triffids, where it occurs when a blinded pianist commits suicide.\n\nAlso featured in the Paul Thomas Anderson film The Master.\n", "context_len": 773, "questions": ["Which poet wrote the 1817 poem 'So We'll Go No More A-Roving'?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Shetland lamb", "Burnside, Shetland", "Shetland Islands (council area)", "Shetlandshire", "County of Shetland", "Sand, Shetland Islands", "Shetland islands", "Shetland (Scotland)", "Shetland (islands council area of Scotland)", "Shetland, Scotland", "Shetland", "Shetland Islands", "County of Zetland", "Shetland Isles", "\u021cetland", "Hjaltland", "Shetland Islands council area", "Shetlanders", "Shetlands", "Shetland Island", "Shetland (council area)", "Yetland", "Shetland Isles council area", "Shetland\u2019s"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nTropic of Capricorn\nThe Tropic of Capricorn (or the Southern Tropic) is the circle of latitude that contains the subsolar point on the December (or southern) solstice. It is thus the southernmost latitude where the Sun can be directly overhead. Its northern equivalent is the Tropic of Cancer.\n\nThe Tropic of Capricorn is one of the five major circles of latitude that mark maps of the Earth. As of , its latitude is    south of the equator, but it is very gradually moving northward, currently at the rate of 0.47 arcseconds, or 15 metres, per year. \n\nGeography and environment\n\nThe Tropic of Capricorn is the dividing line between the Southern Temperate Zone to the south and the tropics to the north. The northern hemisphere equivalent of the Tropic of Capricorn is the Tropic of Cancer.\n\nThe position of the Tropic of Capricorn is not fixed, but rather it varies in a complex manner over time; see under circles of latitude for information.\n\nIn Australia, areas on the Tropic have some of the most variable rainfall in the world  and thus even the wetter areas cannot be generally farmed since irrigation sources invariably dry up in drought years. In southern Africa, where rainfall is more reliable, farming is possible though yields are low even with fertilisers.\n\nIn South America, whilst in the continental cratons soils are almost as old as in Australia and Southern Africa, the presence of the geologically young and evolving Andes means that this region is on the western side of the subtropical anticyclones and thus receives warm and humid air from the Atlantic Ocean. As a result, areas in Brazil adjacent to the Tropic are extremely important agricultural regions, producing large quantities of crops such as coffee, and the natural rainforest vegetation has been entirely cleared. In and west of the Andes, however, the Humboldt Current makes conditions extremely arid, creating one of the driest deserts in the world, so that no glaciers exist between Volc\u00e1n Sajama at 18\u02da30'S and Cerro Tres Cruces at 27\u02daS.  Vegetation here is almost non-existent, though on the eastern slopes of the Andes rainfall is adequate for rainfed agriculture.\n\nAround the world \n\nStarting at the Prime Meridian and heading eastwards, the Tropic of Capricorn passes through 10 countries:\n\nPlaces located along the Tropic of Capricorn\n\nThe following cities and landmarks are either located near the Tropic of Capricorn, or the tropic passes through them.\n\n;; Argentina\n* Andes Mountains\n* The Pampas\n* San Salvador de Jujuy\n\n;; Australia\n* Paraburdoo, Western Australia\n* Newman, Western Australia\n* Lake Disappointment, Western Australia\n* Gibson Desert, Western Australia\n* Ikuntji (Haast's Bluff), Northern Territory\n* Alice Springs, Northern Territory\n* Longreach, Queensland\n* Great Dividing Range, Queensland\n* Emerald, Queensland\n* Gracemere, Queensland\n* Rockhampton, Queensland\n* Cape Capricorn, Queensland\n\n;; Botswana\n* Kalahari Desert\n* Khutse Game Reserve\n* Kule\n* Mahalapye\n\n;; Brazil\n* Itaquaquecetuba\n* Mogi das Cruzes\n* Maring\u00e1\n* S\u00e3o Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport\n* S\u00e3o Paulo\n* Sorocaba\n* Tagua\u00ed\n* Ubatuba\n\n;; Chile\n* Atacama Desert\n* Andes Mountains\n* Antofagasta\n\n;; Madagascar\n* Toliara\n\n;; Mozambique\n* Inhambane city\n* Morrumbene\n* Massinga\n\n;; Namibia\n* Walvis Bay\n* Swakopmund\n* Namib Desert\n\n;; Paraguay\n* Concepci\u00f3n\n\n;; South Africa\n* Kruger National Park\n* Polokwane\n* Capricorn District Municipality\n\nFile:Tropico del capricorno Madagascar Regione di Atsimo-Andrefana.jpg|Atsimo-Andrefana Region, Madagascar\nFile:Tropic of Capricorn Jujuy.JPG|The Tropic of Capricorn marked in Jujuy Province in northern Argentina\nFile: Botswana Tropic of Capricorn Sign.JPG|Monument marking the Tropic of Capricorn as it passes through Botswana\nFile:Tropic of Capricorn (Namibia).jpg|A sign marking the Tropic of Capricorn as it passes through Namibia\nFile:Tr\u00f3pico de Capric\u00f3rnio.JPG|Roadway plaque marking the Tropic of Capricorn in the city of Santana do Parna\u00edba, Brazil, at the correct latitude for year 1917.\nFile:TOC sign Brazil.JPG|Marker for the tropic in Maring\u00e1, Paran\u00e1, Brazil, July 2012\n\nFile:tocrockhampton.jpg|Roadside monument marking Tropic of Capricorn in Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia, 28 January 2005\nFile:Tropic-of-Capricorn Rockhampton.jpg|Monument marking Tropic of Capricorn in Rockhampton, Queensland, Australia, 1970\nFile:Tropic of capricorn Australia.jpg|Road sign marking Tropic of Capricorn in Western Australia, Australia, 26 August 2008\nFile:tropic-capri-australia2.jpg|Monument marking the Tropic of Capricorn just north of Alice Springs, Northern Territory, Australia\n\nList of countries entirely south of the Tropic of Capricorn\n\nAs the major portion of earth's land is located in the Northern Hemisphere there are only four countries entirely south of the Tropic of Capricorn (there are 74 countries entirely north of the Tropic of Cancer):\n* Lesotho\n* New Zealand \n* Swaziland\n* Uruguay\n\nName\n\nThe Tropic of Capricorn is so named because, when it was named about 2,000 years ago, the sun was also in the direction of the constellation Capricornus (capricorn is Latin for goat horn) at the December solstice. In modern times the sun appears in the constellation Sagittarius during this time. The change is due to precession of the equinoxes. The word \"tropic\" itself comes from the Greek trope (\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf\u03c0\u03ae), meaning turn, change in direction or circumstances, referring to the fact that the sun appears to \"turn back\" at the solstices.\n", "context_len": 972, "questions": ["Disregarding Australia as it's a continental land mass, which is the largest island crossed by the Tropic of Capricorn?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Paul Jackson Pollock", "Pollock, Jackson", "Number 1 (painting)", "Jack the Dripper", "Lavender Mist", "Jackson pollock", "Jackson Polluck", "Jackson Pollock", "Jackson Pollack", "One: Number 31", "Number 1 (Jackson Pollock)", "Pollockian"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

She learned to play tennis at the Ealing Lawn Tennis Club where she was first coached by H. Lawrence and later by Charles Martin and Harold Mahony. She won her first senior singles title in 1893 at Ilkley. Between 1893 and 1917 she participated in 21 Wimbledon tournaments. At her first appearance she reached the semifinal of the singles event in which she lost to Blanche Bingley Hillyard.

The following year, 1896, she successfully defended her title in the Challenge Round against Alice Simpson Pickering. Between 1897 and 1901 the titles were divided between Cooper Sterry (1898, 1901) and Bingley Hillyard (1897, 1899, 1900).

{"context": "\nDangerous Davies\nDetective Constable \"Dangerous\" Davies is the central character in a series of comic novels by Leslie Thomas and a TV series, The Last Detective made for ITV.  The first novel in the series was also made into a film for television in 1981. It starred Bernard Cribbins and was scripted by Leslie Thomas. \n\nProfile \n\nDavies is a low-ranked CID officer in the London borough of Willesden. He is nicknamed \"Dangerous\" ironically because he is said to be harmless. His real first name is never revealed. In the novels and TV series he is called \"The Last Detective\" from his superior's assessment of him as \"the last detective, since he was never dispatched on any assignment unless it was very risky or there was no one else to send\". Despite this, Davies is by no means a poor detective, and although he can take longer than his colleagues, and is dogged by bad luck, he does usually \"get his man\" in the end. \n\nThe first story had him drifting into the years-old unsolved case of the disappearance of Celia Norris, a local girl with a dark side.  With his friend, the perpetually unemployed and well-read Mod Lewis (he spends all his time at the library to save on heating) he tracks down the culprit, collecting plenty of cuts, bumps and bruises along the way at the hands of the local thugs.  At one point he is \"binned\" \u2014 an empty dustbin is placed over his head, pinning his arms, and the outside is then hit with pickaxe handles.\n\nBernard Cribbins played Davies in the first television version of this story, made in 1981.  At the end he was swathed in so many bandages as to be unrecognizable, and confined temporarily to a wheelchair. In his later appearances he has been portrayed by Peter Davison from 2003 to 2007.\n\nMuch of the appeal of the books and TV series lies in the comical interactions between Davies and the other characters. His kindly manner enables him to gain the confidence of witnesses and suspects, many of whom reveal their eccentricities to him. Other humour comes from his friendship with Mod, and from his relationship with his estranged wife Doris (Julie in the TV series).\n\nList of novels\n\n*Dangerous Davies: The Last Detective (1976)\n*Dangerous in Love (1987)\n*Dangerous by Moonlight (1993)\n*Dangerous Davies and the Lonely Heart (1998)\n\nAdaptations\n\nFilm\n\nSelected credits\n\n*Bernard Cribbins as DC \"Dangerous\" Davies\n*Bill Maynard as Mod Lewis\n*Joss Ackland as Chief Inspector Yardbird\n*Bernard Lee as Sergeant Ben (Lee's final role before his death)\n*Directed by Val Guest\n*Written by Val Guest and Leslie Thomas\nHome media\n\nThis production is available on DVD, distributed by Acorn Media UK.\n\nTV series\n\nThe ITV drama series aired between 2003 and 2007, and comprised 17 episodes of 70 (later 90) minutes.

{"context": "\nReligion in Nepal\nNepal is a secular state. Prior to the movement for democracy in early 2006 and the sacking of King Gyanendra in 2008, the country was officially a Hindu state. Hinduism is the majority religion in the state and profoundly influences its social structure, while Buddhism (Tibetan Buddhism) is practiced by some ethnic groups (for example Newar) in forms which are strongly influenced by Hinduism; Kiratism otherwise is the grassroots native religion of populations belonging to the Kirati ethnicity. Islam and Christianity have made inroads and are the religious identity of small populations.\n\nHistory \n\nAccording to the 2011 census, 81.3% of the Nepalese population was Hindu, 9.0% was Buddhist, 4.4% was Muslim, 3.0% was Kiratist (indigenous ethnic religion), 1.42% was Christian, and 0.9% follow other religions or no religion.\n\nAccording to the 2001 census, 80.62 percent of Nepalese were Hindu, 10.74 percent Buddhist, 4.20 percent Muslim,  3.60 percent Kirant (an indigenous religion), 0.45 percent Christian, and 0.4 percent were classified as other groups such as B\u00f6n religion. In 1971 Hindus were 89.4 percent of the population, Buddhists 7.5 percent, and Kirants statistically 0 percent.  However, statistics on religious groups are complicated by the ubiquity of dual faith practices, particularly among Hindus and Buddhists. Moreover, shifts in the population's religious composition also reflect political changes.\n\nThe geographical distribution of religious groups in the early 1990s revealed a preponderance of Hindus, accounting for at least 87 percent of the population in every region. The largest concentrations of Buddhists were found in the eastern hills, the Kathmandu Valley, and the central Tarai; in each area about 10 percent of the people were Buddhist. Buddhism was more common among the Newar and Tibeto-Nepalese groups. Among the Tibeto-Nepalese, those most influenced by Hinduism were the Magar, Sunwar, and Rai peoples. Hindu influence was less prominent among the Gurung, Limbu, Bhote, Tamang and Thakali groups, who continued to employ Buddhist monks for their religious ceremonies. Since both Hinduism as well as Buddhism are Dharmic religions, they usually accept each other's practices and many people practice a combination of both.\n\nIn 2015, a new constitution was adopted and granted equal rights to all religions in Nepal.\n\nHinduism in Nepalese culture\n\nIt is even believed, according to Nepalese theology that Lord Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva had come to Nepal in the form of deer. \n\nEstablishment of Nepal by Ne Muni\n\nHe used to perform religious ceremonies at Teku, the confluence of the Bagmati and Bishnumati rivers.  He is said by legend to have selected a pious cowherd to be the first of the many kings of the Gopala Dynasty.  These rulers are said to have ruled Nepal for over 100 years.  He selected Bhuktaman to be the first king in the line of the Gopal (Cowherd) Dynasty. The Gopal dynasty ruled for 300 years. Yakshya Gupta was the last king of this dynasty. The Kirat Dynasty ruled for 550-700-800 Years. first king of Kirat Yalambar and Gasti was last king of this dynasty. The Licchavi dynasty ruled for 200-350 Years. The Malla Dynasty ruled for 400-600 Years. The Shah dynasty ruled for 300 years, However,this mythology can be challenged as no such name as Ne exists in Nepali or other Sanskrit-derived languages.\n\nFlag of Nepal\n\nIt is believed that Lord Vishnu had organized the Nepali people and given them this flag, with the sun and moon as emblems on it. \n\nIn a Hindu Purana, it is written that it was Lord Shiva who handed the flag to Lord Vishnu, and then Lord Vishnu to Lord Indra, for the purpose for battling demons. \n\nThis type of Flag is seen in all Temples of Nepal and India. This is basically a design of flag that was carried by the Kingdoms since Hinduism was established. India managed to change the shape of its flag into a rectangular flag as it has all types of religions followed,eventhough it has the largest Hindu population of the earth; but Nepal held in the Hindu traditional flag and thus has a unique flag no other country has.\n\nGorakhnath and Gurkhas\n\nIt is said that Gorakhnath came to Nepal in the reign of the 8th Thakuri King. \n\nThe Gurkhas of Nepal are the descendants of Gorakhnath of the Nath sect. Gorakhnath was a disciple of Machendranath, a backward-caste saint.\n\nMachendrajatra is a national festival in Nepal to celebrate the birth of the saint. It is said that the Gurkha war-cry to this day is \"Guru Gorakhnath ki jai\".   It is more often said that their war cry is Jaya Mahakali, Ayo Gorkhali (Nepali: \u091c\u092f \u092e\u0939\u093e\u0915\u093e\u0932\u0940, \u0906\u092f\u094b \u0917\u094b\u0930\u094d\u0916\u093e\u0932\u0940) (Glory to Great Kali, The Gorkhas are coming!)\n\nAccording to a Terai myth, when the Pandavas were ascending to heaven, they all fell, but Bhima from the Pandava brothers was rescued by Gorakhnath. \n\nOne Nepalese myth says that as Gorakhnath arrived in Nepal, the terrible dought in occurring in the period halted!\n", "context_len": 935, "questions": ["The main religion in Nepal is a style of what?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Pieman (disambiguation)", "Pie man", "The Pie man.", "Pieman", "Pie Man"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

(with pictures)\nWhat is a Bullet Train?\nLast Modified Date: 29 November 2016\nCopyright Protected:\nThese 10 facts about space will blow your mind\nA bullet train is a term used to describe a high-speed passenger rail train. Originating in Japan, it is so named because of its sleek, aerodynamic appearance and its speed. The actual Japanese word for this rail service is Shinkansen, which, when literally translated into English, means \u201cnew trunk lines.\u201d\nPublic transportation is an important element of Japanese society, as the topography of the island nation limits the amount of available and usable space for roads. For many people, mass transportation is their main means of transportation. In light of this fact, the bullet train was conceived as a high-speed railway that would reduce the travel time between Japan\u2019s large cities.\nThe train achieves its high speed through the use of an aerodynamic shape and technology designed to fully maximize the power of the train. The railroad tracks for it were developed specifically for high-speed rail service. Conventional trains do not run on the Shinkansen lines and high-speed trains do not run on conventional tracks. This allows the trains to run at consistently high speeds, without having to reduce their operating speeds for slower trains on the tracks.\nThe tracks are not designed to go around hills or mountains. Rather, a system of tunnels and viaducts allow the trains to go through any obstruction, which helps the Shinkansen maintain its high speeds. There are no railroad crossings, no changes of the right-of-way, and limited stops on the route.\nThe bullet train began service in Japan in late 1964, connecting the cities of Tokyo and Osaka. The original trains traveled at approximately 125 miles per hour (200 kilometers per hour.) This allowed the 320 mile (550 kilometer) distance between Tokyo and Osaka to be traveled in about three hours.\nToday, the system consists of eight lines of service throughout most of Japan. It can reach speeds of up to 200 miles per hour (322 kilometers per hour) and make the journey between Tokyo and Osaka in approximately two and one-half hours. Since the Shinkansen began operation in 1964, over 6 billion passengers have traveled on the railway, and there have been no major accidents.\nThe success of the high-speed rail line in Japan encouraged other nations to develop their own similar programs. High-speed rail is now a fixture of mass transportation in many European and Asian nations. Two of the more notable services are in France and Spain.\nThe French Train \u00e0 Grande Vitesse (TGV) line is widely considered to be the most extensive high-speed rail system in Europe. The TGV began service in 1981 between the cities of Paris and Lyon. By 2007, the line had over 200 destinations throughout France and in neighboring countries such as Germany, Switzerland, and Luxembourg. It is estimated that, as of 2009, the system has carried in excess of 1.3 billion passengers since service began.\nSpain's bullet train service, known as the Alta Velocidad Espa\u00f1ola, or AVE, began service in 1992 between the cities of Seville and Madrid. It has now expanded north to the city of Barcelona and south of Seville to the city of Malaga. Spain is planning future expansion of the line, which would ultimately create a larger network than the French line.\nOther nations with high-speed rail include the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Portugal Taiwan and South Korea. China began development of its own program in the late 1990s and early 2000s. High-speed service began in Shanghai in 2004, and in 2008, service between Beijing and Tianjin was inaugurated. China is now embarking on an ambitious expansion program to provide high-speed service throughout the nation.\nAd\n", "context_len": 719, "questions": ["Where would you find a 'Bullet Train'?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Dame Anita Lucia Roddick", "Anita Roddick", "Anita Lucia Roddick", "Anita Rodick", "Gordon Roddick", "Anita Roddick Foundation"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

So, the upper chamber had to go.\nTwo days later, by Act of Parliament, the House of Lords was dissolved \u2013 but not, as it turned out, for long. The Parliamentarians argued among themselves in the years that followed, and in 1660, the future Charles II seized his chance to grab the throne.\nCharles offered up a host of concessions to Parliament in his Declaration of Breda. Parliament responded by offering to forget the whole thing. The English republic had never existed and Charles had, in fact, been king all along since his father\u2019s death.\nWith the return of the king came the return of the House of Lords, along with many of the powers it had enjoyed prior to the wars. And that\u2019s how things more or less stood for the next 250 years.\nSince 1911, there have been numerous attempts to reform the unelected upper chamber, with marginal degrees of success. The latest was last year\u2019s House of Lords Reform Act that allows members of the House to resign.\nTHE END OF OIL\nUnderstanding how the end of oil will affect your life and money is the single most important thing you\u2019ll do in the next decade.\nAnd it will affect you, because it\u2019ll affect everyone. But only a handful of people will be bold enough to see what\u2019s happening and move early to take advantage.\nThat\u2019s exactly what our research report \u201cThe End of Oil\u201d is designed to help you do.\nTrump's tax plans will jump-start the US economy\nHow Bernie Madoff cornered the market for hot chocolate\n", "context_len": 511, "questions": ["Which institution was abolished as \u2018useless and dangerous\u2019 in 1649?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["The Wanderer", "Wanderer (disambiguation)", "The Wanderer (album)", "Wanderer", "Wanderer (album)", "The Wanderer (song)", "Wanderers", "The Wanderer (disambiguation)", "WANDERERS", "The wanderers", "The Wanderers", "The Wanderer (novel)", "The Wanderers (novel)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nThe Inspector Lynley Mysteries\nThe Inspector Lynley Mysteries is a British crime drama, broadcast on BBC One from March 12, 2001, to June 1, 2008, encompassing six series and a total of twenty-three episodes. The protagonist, Detective Inspector Thomas \"Tommy\" Lynley, 8th Earl of Asherton (Nathaniel Parker), who is assigned to Scotland Yard, finds himself paired with Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers (Sharon Small). In addition to the tensions involved in solving murder cases, the series thrives on the characters' clashes regarding personality, gender, and class, as Lynley is dapper, male and a peer of the realm, while Havers is untidy, female and comes from a working-class background.\n\nIn August 2007, the BBC announced its intention to stop production of The Inspector Lynley Mysteries. Fans of the series mounted a campaign to save the series with a petition and contacts to the BBC, but to no avail. All six series have since been released on DVD, distributed by Acorn Media UK. \n\nProduction\n\nAll episodes from the first two series and two from the third are based on novels by the American writer Elizabeth George, though the plots and characters are often significantly altered. Later episodes are original stories for television based on her characters. The theme music for the series was composed by Debbie Wiseman. The first episode, A Great Deliverance, was broadcast on March 12 and 13, 2001, becoming the only two-part episode throughout the series run. It was also based on the inaugural Inspector Lynley novel. The first full series began broadcasting on April 8, 2002, with the first episode based on and named after the third novel, Well-Schooled in Murder. The first eleven episodes were based on, and named after, the eleven Inspector Lynley novels published from 1988 to 2001, beginning with the inaugural novel A Great Deliverance, but subsequently departing from the print sequence. Eight more novels have since been published as of 2015.\n\nFilming\n\nExterior shots of Lynley and Havers' base were filmed at the Bircham Dyson Bell solicitors offices on Broadway, central London. The first episode of series five was notable for being shot in Dungeness in Kent.  In the first episode, Lynley drove a Peugeot 607; whereas in both series one and two he drove a Jensen Interceptor; and in later episodes a Bristol 410. Despite the frequently recurring remark in PBS Mystery! presenter Diana Rigg's introductions to the series that Lynley \"is the one with the Bentley\", he never drove a Bentley on TV. He does, however, drive one in the George novels. In the pilot episode, the character of Helen Clyde was played by Emma Fielding. She was later portrayed by Lesley Vickerage for series one through three and, as Lynley's wife, by Catherine Russell in series four and five.\n\nCast\n\n* Nathaniel Parker - Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley\n* Sharon Small - Sergeant/Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers\n* Emma Fielding - Helen Clyde (Pilot)\n* Lesley Vickerage - Helen Clyde (Series 1-3)\n* Catherine Russell - Helen Lynley (Series 4-5)\n* Paul Hickey - Lafferty (Series 4-6)\n* Shaun Parkes - Detective Constable Winston Nkata (Series 5-6)\n\nEpisode list\n\nPilot (2001)\n\nSeries 1 (2002)\n\nSeries 2 (2003)\n\nSeries 3 (2004)\n\nSeries 4 (2005)\n\nSeries 5 (2006)\n\nSeries 6 (2008)\n\nThe broadcast of Limbo and Know Thine Enemy was initially postponed.

{"context": "\nLittle grebe\nThe little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), also known as dabchick, is a member of the grebe family of water birds. The genus name is from Ancient Greek takhus \"fast\" and bapto \"to sink under\". The specific ruficollis is from Latin rufus \"red\" and Modern Latin -collis, \"-necked\", itself derived from Latin collum \"neck\".\n\nAt 23 to in length it is the smallest European member of its family. It is commonly found in open bodies of water across most of its range.\n\nDescription\n\nThe little grebe is a small water bird with a pointed bill. The adult is unmistakable in summer, predominantly dark above with its rich, rufous colour neck, cheeks and flanks, and bright yellow gape. The rufous is replaced by a dirty brownish grey in non-breeding and juvenile birds.\n\nJuvenile birds have a yellow bill with a small black tip, and black and white streaks on the cheeks and sides of the neck as seen below. This yellow bill darkens as the juveniles age, eventually turning black in adulthood.\n\nIn winter, its size, buff plumage, with a darker back and cap, and \u201cpowder puff\u201d rear end enable easy identification of this species. The little grebe's breeding call, given singly or in duet, is a trilled repeated weet-weet-weet or wee-wee-wee which sounds like a horse whinnying.\n\nTaxonomy\n\nThere are nine currently-recognized subspecies of little grebe, separated principally by size and colouration.\n* T. r. ruficollis \u2013 (Pallas, 1764): nominate, found from Europe and western Russia south to North Africa\n* T. r. iraquensis \u2013 (Ticehurst, 1923): found in southeastern Iraq and southwestern Iran\n* T. r. capensis \u2013 (Salvadori, 1884): found in Sub-Saharan Africa, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, and the Indian subcontinent, extending east to Burma\n* T. r. poggei \u2013 (Reichenow, 1902): found from southeastern to northeastern Asia, Hainan, Taiwan, Japan, and south Kuril Islands\n* T. r. philippensis \u2013 (Bonnaterre, 1790): found in the northern Philippines\n* T. r. cotabato \u2013 (Rand, 1948): found on Mindanao\n\nThe following three subspecies are sometimes split as the tricolored grebe (Tachybaptus tricolor):\n* T. r. tricolor \u2013 (Gray, GR, 1861): found from Sulawesi to New Guinea and the Lesser Sundas\n* T. r. vulcanorum \u2013 (Rensch, 1929): found from Java to Timor\n* T. r. collaris \u2013 (Mayr, 1945): found from northeastern New Guinea to Bougainville\n\nDistribution\n\nThis bird breeds in small colonies in heavily vegetated areas of freshwater lakes across Europe, much of Asia down to New Guinea, and most of Africa. Most birds move to more open or coastal waters in winter, but it is only migratory in those parts of its range where the waters freeze. Outside of breeding season, it moves into more open water, occasionally even appearing on the coast in small bays.\n\nBehaviour\n\nThe little grebe is an excellent swimmer and diver and pursues its fish and aquatic invertebrate prey underwater. It uses the vegetation skilfully as a hiding place.\n\nLike all grebes, it nests at the water's edge, since its legs are set very far back and it cannot walk well. Usually four to seven eggs are laid. When the adult bird leaves the nest it usually takes care to cover the eggs with weeds. This makes it less likely to be detected by predators. The young leave the nest and can swim soon after hatching, and chicks are often carried on the backs of the swimming adults. In India, the species breeds during the rainy season.\n\nIt does not normally interbreed with the larger grebes in the Old World, but a bird in Cornwall mated with a vagrant North American pied-billed grebe, producing hybrid young.\n", "context_len": 721, "questions": ["The dabchick is an alternative name for which diving bird?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Moskou", "Moskow", "Moscow, USSR", "Moscow, Russian Federation", "MOCKBA", "Moscovite", "Mosc\u00fa", "Moscova", "Moscou", "Moscow", "Capital of Russia", "RU-MOW", "Architecture of Moscow", "Moskva, Russia", "RUMOW", "Demographics of Moscow", "City of Moscow", "\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u0432\u0430", "Western Moscow", "UN/LOCODE:RUMOW", "Moscow, Russia", "Moscow (Russia)", "Moscva", "Moscow, Soviet Union", "Mockba", "Moskva (city)", "Moscow, Russian SFSR", "Moskva Federal City, Russia", "Moscow, Russia (Federation)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}
{"context": "\nWheat Field with Cypresses\nA Wheatfield with Cypresses (occasionally called A Cornfield with Cypresses) is any of three similar 1889 oil paintings by Vincent van Gogh, as part of his wheat field series.  All were executed at the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole mental asylum at Saint-R\u00e9my near Arles, France, where Van Gogh was voluntarily a patient from May 1889 to May 1890.  The works were inspired by the view from the window at the asylum towards the Alpilles mountains.\n\nThe painting depicts golden fields of ripe wheat, a dark fastigiate Proven\u00e7al cypress towering like a green obelisk to the right and lighter green olive trees in the middle distance, with hills and mountains visible behind, and white clouds swirling in an azure sky above.  The first version (F717)  was painted in late June or early July 1889, during a period of frantic painting and shortly after Van Gogh completed The Starry Night, at a time when he was fascinated by the cypress.  It is likely to have been painted \"en plein air\", near the subject, when Van Gogh was able to leave the precincts of the asylum.  Van Gogh regarded this work as one of his best summer paintings.  In a letter to his brother, Theo, written on 2 July 1889, Vincent described the painting: \"I have a canvas of cypresses with some ears of wheat, some poppies, a blue sky like a piece of Scotch plaid; the former painted with a thick impasto like the Monticelli's, and the wheat field in the sun, which represents the extreme heat, very thick too.\"\n\nVan Gogh suffered a bout of severe mental illness in late July and early August, but was able to resume painting in late August and early September 1889.  After making a reed-pen drawing of the work, now held by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, he copied the composition twice in oils in his studio, one approximately the same size (F615) and a smaller version (F743).  The larger studio version was probably painted in a single sitting, with a few minor later adjustments adding touches of yellow and brown.  Van Gogh sketched out the design with charcoal underdrawing; he applied thin paint on the cypress trees and sky, with the ground allowed to show in places, and thick impasto for the foreground wheat and the clouds above.   Characteristically, he preferred the brilliant white of zinc white (zinc oxide) for the white clouds rather than lead white, despite its poor drying qualities, with his palette also including cobalt blue for the sky, shades of chrome yellow for the wheat field, viridian and emerald green for the bushes and cypresses, and touches of vermilion for the poppies in the foreground and also synthetic ultramarine.   The July \"plein air\" version was much more heavily worked, and may be considered a study for the more considered September studio painting.  He sent the smaller and less accomplished studio version to his mother and sister as a gift.\n\nVincent sent the larger July and September versions to his brother in Paris later in September 1889.  The July version was sold by Theo's widow in 1900 to artist \u00c9mile Schuffenecker.  It passed through the hands of collector Alexandre Berthier and art dealer Paul Cassirer in Paris, where it was first exhibited and photographed at Galerie Eug\u00e8ne Druet in November 1909.  It was sold to banker Franz von Mendelssohn (1865\u20131935) in Berlin in 1910 and remained with the Mendelssohn family in Germany and Switzerland until it was sold to industrialist Emil B\u00fchrle in Zurich in 1952.  His son, Dieter B\u00fchrle, sold the painting in 1993 to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York for $57 million using funds donated by publisher, diplomat and philanthropist Walter Annenberg.\n\nThe National Gallery in London holds a similar version painted in Van Gogh's studio in September 1889, bought with the Courtauld Fund in 1923.  It is unlined, and was never varnished or waxed.  The third smaller version is held by a private collection (sold at Sotheby's in London in 1970; in the US in 1987).\n\nVan Gogh - Weizenfeld mit Zypressen2.jpeg|Reed-pen drawing, held by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam (F1538)\nVan Gogh - Weizenfeld mit Zypressen4.jpeg| Small version in a private collection,  by 65 cm (F743), September 1889\n\nFootnotes\n", "context_len": 805, "questions": ["Which artist painted A Wheatfield With Cypresses in 1889?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Canada", "Canad\u00e1", "The Dominion of Canada", "Commonwealth of Canada", "Dominion of canada", "ISO 3166-1:CA", "Etymology of Canada", "CANADA", "Canadiophile", "Canada's", "\u1472\u14c7\u1455", "Canada/References", "America's top hat", "Canada.", "Cnada", "\u010canada", "Canadian Federation", "Kenadian", "Canadialand", "Xanada", "Dominion of Canada", "Canadaa"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

In 1701, Captain William Kidd was hanged in London for piracy and murder.\nLead Story\nPolice kill famous outlaws Bonnie and Clyde\nShare this:\nPolice kill famous outlaws Bonnie and Clyde\nAuthor\nPolice kill famous outlaws Bonnie and Clyde\nURL\nPublisher\nA+E Networks\nOn this day in 1934, notorious criminals Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow are shot to death by Texas and Louisiana state police while driving a stolen car near Sailes, Louisiana.\nBonnie Parker met the charismatic Clyde Barrow in Texas when she was 19 years old and her husband (she married when she was 16) was serving time in jail for murder. Shortly after they met, Barrow was imprisoned for robbery. Parker visited him every day, and smuggled a gun into prison to help him escape, but he was soon caught in Ohio and sent back to jail. When Barrow was paroled in 1932, he immediately hooked up with Parker, and the couple began a life of crime together.\nAfter they stole a car and committed several robberies, Parker was caught by police and sent to jail for two months. Released in mid-1932, she rejoined Barrow. Over the next two years, the couple teamed with various accomplices to rob a string of banks and stores across five states\u2013Texas, Oklahoma, Missouri, New Mexico and Louisiana. To law enforcement agents, the Barrow Gang\u2013including Barrow\u2019s childhood friend, Raymond Hamilton, W.D. Jones, Henry Methvin, Barrow\u2019s brother Buck and his wife Blanche, among others\u2013were cold-blooded criminals who didn\u2019t hesitate to kill anyone who got in their way, especially police or sheriff\u2019s deputies. Among the public, however, Parker and Barrow\u2019s reputation as dangerous outlaws was mixed with a romantic view of the couple as \u201cRobin Hood\u201d-like folk heroes.\nTheir fame was increased by the fact that Bonnie was a woman\u2013an unlikely criminal\u2013and by the fact that the couple posed for playful photographs together, which were later found by police and released to the media. Police almost captured the famous duo twice in the spring of 1933, with surprise raids on their hideouts in Joplin and Platte City, Missouri. Buck Barrow was killed in the second raid, and Blanche was arrested, but Bonnie and Clyde escaped once again. In January 1934, they attacked the Eastham Prison Farm in Texas to help Hamilton break out of jail, shooting several guards with machine guns and killing one.\nTexan prison officials hired a retired Texas police officer, Captain Frank Hamer, as a special investigator to track down Parker and Barrow. After a three-month search, Hamer traced the couple to Louisiana, where Henry Methvin\u2019s family lived. Before dawn on May 23, Hamer and a group of Louisiana and Texas lawmen hid in the bushes along a country road outside Sailes. When Parker and Barrow appeared, the officers opened fire, killing the couple instantly in a hail of bullets.\nAll told, the Barrow Gang was believed responsible for the deaths of 13 people, including nine police officers. Parker and Barrow are still seen by many as romantic figures, however, especially after the success of the 1967 film Bonnie and Clyde, starring Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty.\n__________________________________________________________________\n", "context_len": 670, "questions": ["Which well known couple died in 1934?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Stanley (TV series)", "Stanley (company)", "Stanley (disambiguation)", "Stanley (TV Show)", "Stanley", "Stanley (film)"], "dataset": "triviaqa"}

{"context": "\nFear of mice\nFear of mice and rats is one of the most common specific phobias. It is sometimes referred to as musophobia (from Greek \u03bc\u1fe6\u03c2 \"mouse\") or murophobia (a coinage from the taxonomic adjective \"murine\" for the family Muridae that encompasses mice and rats), or as suriphobia, from French souris, \"mouse\". \n\nThe phobia, as an unreasonable and disproportionate fear, is distinct from reasonable concern about rats and mice contaminating food supplies, which may potentially be universal to all times, places, and cultures where stored grain attracts rodents, which then consume or contaminate the food supply.\n\nCause\n\nIn many cases a phobic fear of mice is a socially induced conditioned response, combined with (and originated in) the startle response (a response to an unexpected stimulus) common in many animals, including humans, rather than a real disorder. At the same time, as is common with specific phobias, an occasional fright may give rise to abnormal anxiety that requires treatment.\n\nTreatment\n\nFear of mice may be treated by any standard treatment for specific phobias. The standard treatment of animal phobia is systematic desensitization, and this can be done in the consulting room (in vivo), or in hypnosis (in vitro). Some clinicians use a combination of both in vivo and in vitro desensitization during treatment. It is also helpful to encourage patients to experience some positive associations with mice: thus, the feared stimulus is paired with the positive rather than being continuously reinforced by the negative. \n\nPopular culture\n\nAn exaggerated, phobic fear of mice and rats has traditionally been depicted as a stereotypical trait of women, with numerous books, cartoons, television shows, and films portraying hysterical women screaming and jumping atop chairs or tables at the sight of a mouse \u2013 for example, Mammy Two Shoes in Tom and Jerry. Despite the gender-stereotyped portrayal Western musophobia has always been experienced by individuals of both sexes.\n\n*In George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four the protagonist Winston Smith has a phobic fear of rats.\n*In Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Henry Jones is described as being \"scared to death\" of rats.\n*The titular character in the Doraemon series is scared of mice, due to having had his robotic ears bitten off by mice.\n\nElephants and mice\n\nThere is a common Western folk belief that elephants are afraid of mice. The earliest reference to this claim is probably by Pliny the Elder in his Naturalis Historia, book VIII. As translated by Philemon Holland (1601), \"Of all other living creatures, they [elephants] cannot abide a mouse or a rat.\" Numerous zoos and zoologists have shown that elephants can be conditioned not to react. MythBusters performed an experiment in which, indeed, multiple elephants did attempt to avoid a mouse, showing there may be some basis for this belief. It is not known why elephants should react in this way, though there are several theories. Regardless, elephantine murophobia remains the basis of various jokes and metaphors.\n\nIn the Malay Archipelago, one of the fables of \"Sang Kancil\" tells of a meeting among all animals to choose a king from among them. The elephant, deer, tiger, and mouse offered themselves to be elected and it was decided that they should have a series of contests between them to decide the matter. After the deer and tiger are eliminated, the mouse and the elephant compete in a duel. The mouse tried to beat and bite at the elephant but the elephant's hide was thick. Because the elephant thought he was strong, he just sat and laughed at the mouse. The mouse got angry and finally climbed into the elephant's ear. The elephant got afraid and stomped his feet. The mouse then got afraid and bit the elephant's eardrum as hard as he could. The elephant was in great pain and ran around and hit all the tree trunks. Finally, the elephant admitted defeat and the mouse was declared king.\n\nPatron saint\n\nGertrude of Nivelles is the patron saint of murophobia, and is also invoked against rats and mice in general.\n", "context_len": 779, "questions": ["Murophobia is the abnormal fear of what?"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["Charlie don't surf!", "Charlie doesn't surf", "Tyrone %22Mr. Clean%22 Miller", "Benjamin L.

{"context": "\nOrchiectomy\nOrchiectomy (also named orchidectomy, and sometimes shortened as orchi) is a surgical procedure in which one or both testicles are removed. The removal of both testicles (bilateral orchiectomy) is the surgical form of castration.\n\nThere are three main types of orchiectomy: simple, subcapsular, and inguinal. The first two types are usually done under local or epidural anesthesia, and take about 30 minutes to perform. An inguinal orchiectomy is sometimes done under general anesthesia, and takes between 30 minutes and an hour to complete.\n\nSimple orchiectomy\n\nA simple orchiectomy is commonly performed as part of sex reassignment surgery (SRS) for transgender women, or as palliative treatment for advanced cases of prostate cancer. The patient lies flat on an operating table with the penis taped against the abdomen. The nurse will shave a small area for the incision. After anesthetic has been administered, the surgeon makes an incision in the midpoint of the scrotum and cuts through the underlying tissue. The surgeon removes the testicles and parts of the spermatic cord through the incision. The incision is closed with two layers of sutures and covered with a surgical dressing. If the patient desires, a prosthetic testicle can be inserted before the incision is closed to present an outward appearance of a pre-surgical scrotum.\n\nSubcapsular orchiectomy\n\nA subcapsular orchiectomy is also commonly performed for treatment of prostate cancer. The operation is similar to that of a simple orchiectomy, with the exception that the glandular tissue that surrounds each testicle is removed rather than the entire gland itself. This type of orchiectomy is done primarily to keep the appearance of an ordinary scrotum.\n\nInguinal orchiectomy\n\n(See:inguinal orchiectomy)\n\nInguinal orchiectomy (named from the Latin inguin for \"groin,\" and also called radical orchiectomy), is performed when an onset of testicular cancer is suspected, in order to prevent a possible spread of cancer from the spermatic cord into the lymph nodes near the kidneys.\n\nAn inguinal orchiectomy can be either unilateral or bilateral. The surgeon makes an incision in the patient's groin area (in contrast to an incision in the scrotum, as is done in both simple and subcapsular orchiectomies). The entire spermatic cord is removed, as well as the testicle(s). A long, non-absorbable suture may be left in the stump of the spermatic cord in case later surgery is deemed necessary.\n\nAfter the cord and testicle have been removed, the surgeon washes the area with saline solution and closes the various layers of tissues and skin with various types of sutures. The wound is then covered with sterile gauze and bandaged.\n", "context_len": 485, "questions": ["What is removed during an operation called an orchidectomy"], "num_question": 1, "answer": ["The United States of America", "United States Of Amerca", "Us of a", "U.\u2013S.\u2013A.", "Americaland", "United States (U.S.A.)", "Amurika", "Unite states of america", "United States of America (redirect)", "The U S A", "Unietd States", "EE UU", "The U.S.A.", "U.-S.-A.", "Usa", "United Staets of America", "Unites States", "\u00c9tats-Unis d'Am\u00e9rique", "Verenigde State", "U.\u2013S.", "The United States of America.", "The U-S-A", "EEUU", "U.
